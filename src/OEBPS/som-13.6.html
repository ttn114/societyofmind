<h2>13.6 the frontier effect</h2>

    <p>
      We can get more insight about children from another experiment of
      Piaget&#39;s. A child is shown a short block resting on a longer one
      and is asked to draw the scene. Next the child is asked to draw a
      sketch of what might happen if we pushed the upper block a little to
      the right.  At first, the result is more or less what we&#39;d
      expect.</p>

    <p>
      But when we ask the child to do the same repeatedly, we see a
      strange result. The top block suddenly grows shorter as it meets the
      edge of the long block!</p>

    <p>
      To understand what happened, just put yourself in the child&#39;s
      place.  You&#39;ve started to draw the upper edge of the short box,
      but how do you decide where to stop?</p>

    <p>
      Younger children don&#39;t yet possess much ability to draw lines in
      good proportion. Instead, they tend to use procedures that locate
      each new feature in some recognizable relationship to other features
      already represented in the drawing &mdash; that is, to <em>easily
	described places</em> that have previously been depicted. Since
      there are no such features near the middle of the long block, the
      child will use the same method, whatever it is, for the first few
      drawings. But it is easy to describe the location of the end of the
      long block, and that&#39;s why this is where the younger children
      tend to stop, once they approach that neighborhood.  Piaget called
      this the <em>frontier effect</em> &mdash; the tendency to place new
      features at locations that have easily described relationships to
      other, already represented features.</p>

    <p>
      Why can&#39;t children simply copy what they see? We adults
      don&#39;t appreciate how complicated copying really is &mdash;
      because we can&#39;t recall what it was like before we learned to do
      it. To make a good copy, the child would have to draw each line to a
      scale and direction consistent with all the others. But these young
      children are scarcely able to trace the outline of an object with a
      finger; they certainly cannot mentally transport an entire figure
      shape from one location to another. So it is actually easier for the
      child to do what adults might consider more <em>abstract</em>: first
      to construct a mental description of the relations involved in the
      scene, and then to design a drawing -scheme to represent those
      relationships. It can require more skill to produce what we regard
      as a simple copy or imitation than to produce what we consider to be
      an <em>abstract</em> representation!</p>
