<h1>18 Reasoning</h1>
<h2>18.1 must machines be logical?</h2>

    <p>
      What&#39;s wrong with the old arguments that lead us to believe that
      if machines could ever think at all, they&#39;d have to think with
      perfect logic?  We&#39;re told that by their nature, all machines
      must work according to rules. We&#39;re also told that they can only
      do exactly what they&#39;re told to do. Besides that, we also hear
      that machines can only handle quantities and therefore cannot deal
      with qualities or anything like analogies.</p>

    <p>
      Most such arguments are based upon a mistake that is like confusing
      an agent with an agency. When we design and build a machine, we know
      a good deal about how it works. When our design is based on neat,
      logical principles, we are likely to make the mistake of expecting
      the machine to behave in a similarly neat and logical fashion. But
      that confuses what the machine does inside itself &mdash; that is,
      how it
      <em>works</em> &mdash; with our expectations of how it will appear
      to behave in the outer world. Being able to explain in logical terms
      how a machine&#39;s parts work does not automatically enable us to
      explain its subsequent activities in simple, logical terms. Edgar
      Allan Poe once argued that a certain chess-playing <em>machine</em>
      had to be fraudulent because it did not always win. If it were
      really a machine, he argued, it would be perfectly logical &mdash;
      and therefore could never make any mistakes! What is the fallacy in
      this? Simply that there is nothing to prevent us from using logical
      language to describe illogical reasoning. To a certain extent
      it&#39;s true that machines can do only what they are designed to
      do. But this does not preclude us, when once we know how thinking
      works, from designing machines that think.</p>

    <p>
      When do we actually use logic in real life? We use it to simplify
      and summarize our thoughts. We use it to explain arguments to other
      people and to persuade them that those arguments are right. We use
      it to reformulate our own ideas. But I doubt that we often use logic
      actually to solve problems or to <em>get</em> new ideas. Instead, we
      formulate our arguments and conclusions in logical terms after we
      have constructed or discovered them in other ways; only then do we
      use verbal and other kinds of formal reasoning to <em>clean things
	up,</em> to separate the essential parts from the spaghettilike
      tangles of thoughts and ideas in which they first occurred.</p>

    <p>
      To see why logic must come afterward, recall the idea of solving
      problems by using the generate and test method. In any such process,
      logic can be only a fraction of the reasoning; it can serve as a
      test to keep us from coming to invalid conclusions, but it cannot
      tell us which ideas to generate, or which processes and memories to
      use. Logic no more explains how we think than grammar explains how
      we speak; both can tell us whether our sentences are properly
      formed, but they cannot tell us which sentences to make. Without an
      intimate connection between our knowledge and our intentions, logic
      leads to madness, not intelligence. A logical system without a goal
      will merely generate an endless host of pointless truths like these:</p>

    <p>
      A implies A.  P or not P.  A implies A or A or A.  If 4 is 5, then
      pigs can fly.</p>
