<h2>26.6 sentence and nonsense</h2>

    <p>
      Part of what a sentence means depends upon its separate words, and
      part depends on how those words are arranged.</p>

    <p>
      Round squares steal honestly.  Honestly steal squares round.</p>

    <p>
      What makes these seem so different in character, when both use the
      very same words? I&#39;ll argue that this is because your
      language-agency, immediately upon hearing the first word-string,
      knows exactly what to do with it because it fits a well-established
      sentence-frame. The second string fits no familiar form at all. But
      how do we fit those sentence-frames? We&#39;ll come to that
      presently, but for the moment, let&#39;s simply assume that our
      young listener has somehow come to classify words into various
      types, like nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs. (We&#39;ll ignore
      the fact that children go through other stages before they use words
      as adults do.) Then our first string of words has this form:</p>

    <p>
      Adjective Noun Verb Adverb Now we&#39;ll suppose our listener has
      learned a specific recognition- frame that is activated on hearing
      this string of particular types of words. This frame then executes a
      special process script that makes the following assignments to the
      terminals of a Trans-frame. The neme for <em>steal</em> is assigned
      to the Trans-frame&#39;s Action terminal, while the neme
      for <em>squares</em> is attached to the Actor terminal. The frame
      then activates scripts that modify the action <em>steal</em> by
      applying to it the neme for <em>honestly</em> and modify the
      object <em>squares</em> by applying to it the neme
      for <em>round.</em> Up to this point, everything works smoothly: the
      language-agency has found a use for every word. We have special
      names for the strings of words that we process with such fluency: we
      call them <em>phrases</em> or <em>sentences.</em></p>

    <p>
      A word-string seems <em>grammatical</em> if all its words fit
      quickly and easily into frames that connect suitably to one another.</p>

    <p>
      However, at this point some serious conflicts start to appear within
      some other agencies because of certain incompatibilities. The frame
      for <em>steal</em> requires its Actor to be animate. A square
      can&#39;t steal, because it&#39;s not alive! Besides, the frame
      for <em>steal</em> expects an act that&#39;s reprehensible, and that
      clashes with the modifier for
      <em>honestly.</em> If that weren&#39;t bad enough, our agency for
      describing shape can&#39;t tolerate the polynemes for <em>round</em>
      and <em>square</em> when both are activated at the same time. It
      doesn&#39;t matter that our sentence is grammatical: so much turmoil
      is set up that most of its meaning cancels out and we regard it
      as <em>nonsense.</em> But it is important to recognize that the
      distinction between sense and nonsense is only partly a matter of
      grammar, for consider what happens when you hear these three words:</p>

    <p>
      thief -- -- careless -- -- prison --</p>

    <p>
      Although these do not establish any single well-formed grammar-
      frame, they activate some word-sense nemes that skip past all our
      grammar-forms to fit a familiar story-frame, a moral tale about a
      thief who&#39;s caught and reaps a just reward. Ungrammatical
      expressions can frequently be meaningful when they lead to clear and
      stable mental states. Grammar is the servant of language, not the
      master.</p>
