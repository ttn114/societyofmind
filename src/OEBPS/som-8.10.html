<h2>8.10 levels and classifications</h2>

    <p>
      Isn&#39;t it interesting how often we find ourselves using the idea
      of level?  We talk about a person&#39;s levels of aspiration or
      accomplishment. We talk about levels of abstraction, levels of
      management, levels of detail. Is there anything in common to all the
      level-things people talk about? Yes: they each appear to reflect
      some way to organize ideas &mdash; and each seems vaguely
      hierarchical. Usually, we tend to think that each of those
      hierarchies illustrates some kind of order that exists in the
      world. But frequently those orderings come from the mind and merely
      appear to belong to the world. Indeed, if our theory of K-line trees
      is correct, it would seem <em>natural</em> for us to classify things
      into levels and hierarchies &mdash; even when this does not work out
      perfectly. The diagram below portrays two ways to classify physical
      objects.</p>

      These two hierarchies split things up in different ways. The birds
      and airplanes are close together on one side, but far apart on the
      other side. Which classification is correct? Silly question! It
      depends on what you want to use it for. The one on the left is more
      useful for biologists, and the one on the right is more useful for
      hunters.</p>

    <p>
      How would you classify a porcelain duck, a pretty decorative toy? Is
      it a kind of bird? Is it an animal? Or is it just a lifeless piece
      of clay? It makes no sense to argue about it: <em>That&#39;s not a
	bird!</em> <em>Oh, yes, it is, and it is also pottery.</em> Instead,
      we frequently use two or more classifications at the same time. For
      example, a thoughtful child can play with a porcelain duck as though
      it were a make-believe animal, yet at the same time treat it
      carefully, in its role as a delicate object.</p>

    <p>
      Whenever we develop a new skill or extend an old one, we have to
      emphasize the relative importance of some aspects and features over
      others. We can place these into neat levels only when we discover
      systematic ways to do so. Then our classifications can resemble
      level-schemes and hierarchies. But the hierarchies always end up
      getting tangled and disorderly because there are also exceptions and
      interactions to each classification scheme. When attempting a new
      task, we never like to start anew: we try to use what has worked
      previously. So we search around inside our minds for old ideas to
      use.  Then, when part of any hierarchy seems to work, we drag the
      rest along with it.</p>
