<h2>12.2 learning meaning</h2>
    
    <p>
      What is learning, anyway? That word is certainly hard to
      define. The child in our Block-Arch scenario has found one way
      to learn one sense of what some adults mean by <em>arch.</em>
      But we can&#39;t assume that the same kinds of processes are
      involved when we learn to recite a poem, to use a spoon, and to
      tie a shoe. What happens when a person learns to read, learns to
      add numbers, learns a new language, learns to anticipate the
      dispositions of a friend, or learns to build a tower that will
      stand? If we tried to find a single definition
      for <em>learning</em> to span so many kinds of processes,
      we&#39;d end up with some phrase too broad to have much use
      &mdash; like this:</p>

    <p>
      <em>Learning</em> is making useful changes in the workings of our
      minds.</p>

    <p>
      The problem is that we use the single word <em>learning</em> to
      cover too diverse a society of ideas. Such a word can be useful in
      the title of a book, or in the name of an institution. But when it
      comes to studying the subject itself, we need more distinctive terms
      for important, different ways to learn. Even that one Block-Arch
      scene reveals at least four different ways to learn. We&#39;ll give
      them these new names:</p>

    <p>
      Uniframing combining several descriptions into one, for example, by
      observing that all the arches have certain common parts.</p>

    <p>
      Accumulating collecting incompatible descriptions, for example, by
      forming the phrase <em>block or wedge.</em></p>

    <p>
      Reformulating modifying a description&#39;s character, for example,
      by describing the separate blocks rather than the overall shape.</p>

    <p>
      Trans-framing bridging between structures and functions or actions,
      for example, by relating the concept of arch to the act of changing
      hands.</p>

    <p>
      These words will be explained in the sections that follow. It seems
      to me that the older words used in psychology &mdash; such as
      generalizing, practicing, conditioning, memorizing, or associating
      &mdash; are either too vague to be useful or have become connected
      to theories that simply aren&#39;t sound. In the meantime, the
      revolutions of computer science and Artificial Intelligence have led
      to new ideas about how various kinds of learning might work, and
      these new ideas deserve new names.</p>

    <p>
      Our Block-Arch scenario is based on a computer program developed by
      Patrick Winston in 1970. Winston&#39;s program required an external
      teacher to provide the examples and to say which of them were arches
      and which were not. In my unprogrammed version of this, the teacher
      has been replaced by the concern of some agency inside the child to
      account for the emergence of that mysterious Hand-Change phenomenon:
      why do certain structures force you to let go of the toy car, while
      other structures don&#39;t? We thus assume that the child is led to
      learn for itself in order to account for strange events. One might
      complain that it only makes learning harder to explain, to make it
      depend upon the child&#39;s curiosity. But if we are ever really to
      understand how our minds grow, we must first face reality: people
      just don&#39;t learn so well unless they&#39;re interested or
      concerned. The older theories of learning and remembering never got
      very far because in trying to oversimplify, they lost essential
      aspects of the context. It wouldn&#39;t be much use to have a theory
      in which knowledge is somehow stored away &mdash; without a
      corresponding theory of how later to put that knowledge back to
      work.</p>
