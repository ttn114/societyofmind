<h2>25.3 the stationary world</h2>

    <p>
      What makes objects seem to stay in place no matter how the viewer
      moves? To common sense this is no mystery: it&#39;s simply that
      we&#39;re seeing all the time and keeping contact with the
      world. However, I suspect that if we had to start seeing all over
      again from every moment to the next, we&#39;d scarcely be able to
      see at all. This is because our higher-level agents
      don&#39;t <em>see</em> the outputs of the sensors in our eyes at
      all. Instead, they <em>watch</em> the states of middle-level
      agencies that don&#39;t change state so frequently. What keeps
      those <em>inner models</em> of the world from changing all the time?
      This is the function of our frame-arrays: to store what we learn
      about the world at terminals that stay unchanged when we move our
      heads and bodies around.  This explains a wonderful pseudoparadox:
      objects in the world seem to change only when the pictures they
      project into our eyes don&#39;t change &mdash; that is, don&#39;t
      change according to our expectations. For example, when you walk
      past a circular dish, your frame-arrays expect that circle to turn
      into an ellipse. When that actually happens,</p>

    <p>
      the shape continues to <em>look</em> circular. However, should that
      expected change fail to occur, the shape will seem to change of its
      own accord.</p>

    <p>
      How, then, do we automatically compensate for changes of view? The
      system could work just as we described in section 24.8: by using the
      same direction-nemes both to control our own motions and to select
      frames from our frame-arrays. For example, you might use several
      frames to represent an image of a cube, arranged in a network like
      this:</p>

    <img class="illus" src="./illus/ch25/25-5.png"/>

    <p>
      When you activate your <em>move east</em> direction-neme in order to
      make your body move in that direction, the same signal will also
      make this frame-array replace the middle frame with the one to its
      left. This will compensate for your change of viewpoint and
      determine what you <em>expect</em> to see &mdash; and the scene will
      appear to remain stationary! Michael Crichton has suggested that
      when you move inside such a space, you must unconsciously be
      registering the distortions of the shape, the moving walls and
      corners. Only you don&#39;t interpret these as changes in the room
      itself, but use them as more accurate cues to orient yourself in the
      space.</p>

    <p>
      You can bypass this entire system by gently pushing the side of your
      eye with your finger; then the world will indeed appear to move,
      because your frame-arrays do not receive the corresponding direction
      signals!</p>
