<h2>19.10 closing the ring</h2>

    <p>
      Now let&#39;s redraw the diagram for the language-agency, but fill
      in more details from the last few sections.</p>
    <img class="illus" src="./illus/ch19/19-10.png"/>

    <p>
      Something amazing happens when you go around a loop like this!
      Suppose you were to imagine three properties of an apple &mdash; for
      example, its substance, taste, and thin-peeled structure. Then, even
      if there were no apple on the scene &mdash; and even if you had not
      yet thought of the word <em>apple</em> &mdash; the recognition-agent
      on the left will be aroused enough to excite your <em>apple</em>
      polyneme. (This is because I used the number three for the required
      sum in the apple polyneme&#39;s recognizer instead of demanding that
      all five properties be present. ) That agent can then arouse the
      K-lines in other agencies, like those for color and shape &mdash;
      and thus evoke your memories of other apple properties! In other
      words, if you start with enough clues to arouse one of your
      apple-nemes, it will automatically arouse memories of the other
      properties and qualities of apples and create a more complete
      impression, <em>simulus,</em> or hallucination of the experience of
      seeing, feeling, and even of eating an apple. This way, a simple
      loop machine can reconstruct a larger whole from clues about only
      certain of its parts!</p>

    <p>
      Many thinkers have assumed that such abilities lie beyond the reach
      of all machines. Yet here we see that retrieving the whole from a
      few of its parts requires no magic leap past logic and necessity,
      but only simple societies of agents that <em>recognize</em> when
      certain requirements are met. If something is red and round and has
      the right size and shape for an apple &mdash; and nothing else seems
      wrong &mdash; then one will probably think <em>apple.</em></p>

    <p>
      This method for arousing complete recollections from incomplete
      clues &mdash; we could call it <em>reminding</em> &mdash; is
      powerful but imperfect. Our speaker might have had in mind not an
      apple, but some other round, red, fruit, such as a tomato or a
      pomegranate. Any such process leads only to guesses &mdash; and
      frequently these will be wrong. Nonetheless, to think effectively,
      we often have to turn aside from certainty &mdash; to take some
      chance of being wrong. Our memory systems are powerful because
      they&#39;re not constrained to be perfect!</p>
