<h2>6.13 self-knowledge is dangerous</h2>

    <p>
      To &ldquo;know oneself&rdquo; more perfectly might seem to
      promise something powerful and good. But there are fallacies
      concealed behind that happy thought. No doubt, a mind that wants
      to change itself could benefit from knowing how it works. But
      such knowledge might as easily encourage us to wreck ourselves
      &mdash; if we had ways to poke our clumsy mental fingers into
      the tricky circuits of the mind&#39;s machinery.  Could this be
      why our brains force us to play those games of mental hide and
      seek?</p>

    <p>
      Just see how prone we are to risk experiments that change ourselves; how
      fatally we&#39;re drawn to drugs, to meditation, music, even
      conversation &mdash; all powerful addictions that can change our very
      personalities. Just see how everyone is entranced by any promise to
      transgress the bounds of normal pleasure and reward.</p>

    <p>
      In ordinary life, our pleasure systems help us learn &mdash; and,
      therefore, to behave ourselves &mdash; by forcing checks and balances on
      us. Why, for example, do we become bored when doing the same thing over
      and over, even if that activity was pleasant at first? This appears to
      be one property of our pleasure systems; without enough variety, they
      tend to satiate. Every learning machine must have some such protective
      scheme, since otherwise it could get trapped into endlessly repeating
      the same activity. We are fortunate to be equipped with mechanisms that
      keep us from wasting too much time, and it is fortunate, too, that we
      find it hard to suppress such mechanisms.</p>

    <p>
      If we could deliberately seize control of our pleasure systems, we could
      reproduce the pleasure of success without the need for any actual
      accomplishment. And that would be the end of everything.</p>

    <p>
      What prevents such meddling? Our minds are bound by many
      self-constraints. For example, we find it hard to determine what&#39;s
      happening inside the mind. Later, when we talk about infant development,
      we&#39;ll see that even if our inner eyes could see what&#39;s there,
      we&#39;d find it singularly hard to change the agents we might want most
      to change &mdash; the ones that, in our infancy, helped shape our
      longest-lasting self-ideals.</p>

    <p>
      These agents are hard to change because of their special evolutionary
      origin. The long-term stability of many other mental agencies depends on
      how slowly we change our images of what we ought to be like. Few of us
      would survive if, left to random chance, our most adventurous impulses
      could tamper freely with the basis of our personalities. Why would that
      be such a bad thing to do? Because an ordinary <em>change of mind</em>
      can be reversed if it leads to a bad result. But when you change your
      self-ideals &mdash; then nothing is left to turn you back.</p>

    <p>
      Sigmund Freud theorized that each person&#39;s growth is governed by
      unconscious needs to please, placate, oppose, or terminate our images of
      parental authority. If we recognized the influence of those old images,
      however, we might consider them too infantile or too unworthy to
      tolerate and seek to replace them with something better.  But then what
      would we substitute for them &mdash; once we divested ourselves of all
      those ties to instinct and society? We&#39;d each end up as instruments
      of even more capricious sorts of self-invented goals.</p>

    <p>
      It&#39;s mainly when our systems fail that consciousness becomes
      engaged. For example, we walk and talk without much sense of how we
      actually do those things. But a person with an injured leg may, for the
      first time, begin to formulate theories about how walking works (<em>To
	turn to the left, I&#39;ll have to push myself that way,</em>) and then
      perhaps consider which muscles might accomplish that goal. When we
      recognize that we&#39;re confused, we begin to reflect on how our minds
      solve problems and engage the little we know about our strategies of
      thought. Then we find ourselves saying things like this:</p>

    <p>
      <em>Now I must get organized. Why can&#39;t I concentrate on the
	important questions and not get distracted by those other nonessential
	details?</em></p>

    <p>
      Paradoxically, it is smart to realize that one is confused &mdash; as
      opposed to being confused without knowing it. For that stimulates us to
      apply our intellect to altering or repairing the defective process. Yet
      we dislike and disparage the sense of confusion, not appreciating the
      quality of this recognition.</p>

    <p>
      However, once your B-brains make you start to ask yourself <em>What was
	I really attempting to do?</em> you can exploit that as an opportunity
      to change your goals or change how you describe your situation. That
      way, you can escape the distress of feeling trapped because there seem
      to be no adequate alternatives. The conscious experience of confusion
      can resemble pain; perhaps this is because of how they both impel us
      to discover ways to escape from a predicament. The difference is that
      confusion is directed against a person&#39;s own failing state of
      mind, whereas pain reflects exterior disturbances. In either case,
      internal processes must be demolished and rebuilt.</p>

    <p>
      Both confusion and pain have injurious effects when they lead us to
      abandon goals on larger scales than appropriate: <em>The entire subject
	makes me feel ill. Perhaps I should abandon the whole project,
	occupation, or relationship.</em> But even such dispiriting thoughts can
      serve as probes for finding other agencies that might be engaged for
      help.</p>
