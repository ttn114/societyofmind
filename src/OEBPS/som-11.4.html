<h2>11.4 innate geography</h2>

    <p>
      We&#39;ve seen that touching nearby spots of skin will usually
      give rise to similar sensations: this is because the
      corresponding nerves run in parallel courses and thus cause
      similar activities inside the brain. The reverse is also usually
      true: the more similar two sensations are, the closer their
      origins in the skin. This has an important consequence:</p>

    <p>
      The nerve pathways that preserve the physical nearness relations of
      our skin-sensors can make it easy for inner agencies to discover
      corresponding nearnesses about the outer world of space.</p>

    <p>
      Moving your hand across an object tells you something about that
      object&#39;s shape. Imagine what must happen when a very young
      infant moves its hand across some object: each continuous motion
      produces a sequence of skin-sensor signals. Over time, various
      mapping agents can first use this information to learn, simply,
      which skin spots are nearest one another. Later, further layers of
      mapping agents could learn which skin spots lie between which
      others; this should be easy, too, because most small-scale motions
      tend to go in nearly straight lines. But then, since space itself is
      just a society of nearness relations between places, this is all the
      information we need to <em>reconstruct</em> the spatial structure of
      the skin. All this is in accord with a basic principle of
      mathematics:</p>

    <p>
      Suppose you were lost in some unknown space &mdash; and could only
      tell which pairs of points were close to one another. That would be
      enough for you to figure a great deal about the space. From that
      alone, you could deduce if you were in a world of two dimensions or
      three. You could tell where there were obstacles and boundaries,
      holes and tunnels and bridges, and so on. You could figure out the
      global layout of that world from just those local bits of
      information about nearnesses.</p>

    <p>
      It is a wonderful fact that, in principle, one can deduce the global
      geography of a space from nothing more than hints about which pairs
      of points lie near one another! But it is another matter to actually
      make such maps, and no one yet knows how the brain does this. To
      design a machine to accomplish such tasks, one could begin with a
      layer of <em>correlation agents,</em> one for each tiny patch of
      skin, each engineered to detect which other skin spots are most
      often aroused at nearly the same times; those will then be mapped as
      the nearest ones. A second layer of similar agents could then begin
      to make maps of larger regions, and several such layers would
      eventually assemble a sequence of maps on various scales, for
      representing several levels of detail.</p>

    <p>
      If brains do something of this sort, it might illuminate a
      problem that has troubled some philosophers: <em>Why do we all
      agree on what the outer world of space is like?</em> Why
      don&#39;t different people interpret space in different, alien
      ways? In principle it is mathematically possible for each person
      to conclude, for example, that the world is three-dimensional
      &mdash; rather than two-or four-dimensional &mdash; just from
      enough experience with nearby pairs of points. However, if the
      wires from the skin to the brain were shuffled and scrambled
      around too much, we would probably never get them straightened
      out because the actual calculations for doing such things would
      be beyond our capabilities.</p>
