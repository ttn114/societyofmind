<h2>13.4 children's drawing-frames</h2>

    <p>
      That body-head drawing seems very wrong to most adults, yet it seems
      to please many children. Does it really look like a person to those
      children? That seems like a simple question, but it is not &mdash;
      for we must remember that a child is not a single agent and that
      various other agencies inside a child&#39;s mind may not be
      satisfied at all. At the moment, those other agencies are not in
      control and have little effect.  Yet if some creature came on the
      scene that really looked like that, most children would be
      terrified. It does not make much sense to speak of what a
      person <em>really</em> sees, because we have so many different
      agencies.</p>

    <p>
      What happened in the intervening years to make the older children
      draw the body separately? This could come about without even making
      any change in the list of features and relations we used in the
      previous section. It would need only a small change in step 2 of our
      drawing procedure:</p>
<img class="illus" src="./illus/ch13/13-10.png" />

    <p>
      This ensures that every feature mentioned in the list will be
      represented only once in the drawing, even if two such features look
      alike. Of course, this requires some ability to count each feature
      only once, and never twice. How interesting that in order to make
      mature, realistic drawings, the child could exploit the same kind of
      ability it must acquire in order to count things properly!</p>

    <p>
      To be sure, we could explain the child&#39;s progress in other
      ways. That new and <em>more realistic</em> picture could come from
      adding a neck to the feature list, for that would demand a separate
      body and head. It might suffice simply to impose an additional
      constraint or relationship: that the head be above the body. One
      might argue that the younger child never had a clear concept of a
      separate and distinct body feature in the first place; after all,
      there are many things that you can do with your arms and legs or
      with your head &mdash; but your body only gets in the way.</p>

    <p>
      In any case, after mastering the art of making these body-head
      drawings, many children seem to progress rather slowly in the art of
      making personal portraits, and these types of <em>childish</em>
      drawings often persist for some years. I suspect that after children
      learn to make recognizable figures, they usually move on to face the
      problems of representing much more complicated scenes. As they do
      this, we should continue to appreciate how well children deal with
      the problems they set for themselves. They may not meet our own
      grown-up expectations, but they often solve their own versions of
      the problems we pose.</p>
