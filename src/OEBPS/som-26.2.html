<h2>26.2 understanding stories</h2>

    <p>
      We&#39;ll now see how frames can help to explain how we understand
      that children&#39;s tale. How do we know that the kite is a present
      for Jack &mdash; when neither sentence mentioned this?</p>

    <p>
      Mary was invited to Jack&#39;s party.  She wondered if he would like
      a kite.</p>

    <p>
      After the first sentence activates a party-invitation frame, the
      reader&#39;s mind remains engaged with that frame&#39;s concerns
      &mdash; including the question of what type of birthday gift to
      bring. If this concern is represented by some subframe, what are the
      concerns of that subframe? That present must be something that will
      please the party host. <em>Toy</em> would be a good default for it,
      since that&#39;s the most usual kind of gift for a child.</p>

    <p>
      Since <em>Jack</em> is a <em>he</em> and a <em>kite</em> is
      a <em>toy,</em> these two frames will merge perfectly &mdash;
      provided that the reader&#39;s frame for boy assumes that Jack is
      likely to enjoy kites. Then our two sentences combine perfectly to
      fill the present frame&#39;s terminals, and our problem is solved!</p>

    <p>
      What makes a story comprehensible? What gives it coherency? The
      secret lies in how each phrase and sentence stirs frames into
      activity or helps already active ones to fill their terminals. When
      the first sentence of our story mentions a party, various frames are
      excited &mdash; and these are still active in the reader&#39;s mind
      when the next sentence is read. The ground is prepared for
      understanding the second sentence because so many agents are already
      ready to recognize possible references to presents, clothes, and
      other matters that might be related to birthday parties.</p>
