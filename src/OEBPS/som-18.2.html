<h2>18.2 chains of reasoning</h2>

    <p>
      Here&#39;s a rule that&#39;s part of ordinary common sense: If A
      depends on B, and B depends on C, then &mdash; clearly &mdash; A
      depends on C. But what do such expressions mean? And why do we make
      the same kinds of inferences not only for dependency but also for
      implication and causality?</p>

    <p>
      If A depends on B, and, also, B depends on C, then A depends on C.
      If A implies B, and, also, B implies C, then A implies C.  If A
      causes B, and, also, B causes C, then A causes C.</p>

    <p>
      What do all these different ideas have in common? All lend
      themselves to being linked into chainlike strings. Whenever we
      discover such sequences &mdash; however long they may be &mdash; we
      regard it as completely natural to compress them into single links,
      by deleting all but the beginning and the end. This lets
      us <em>conclude,</em> for example, that A depends on, implies, or
      causes C. We do this even with imaginary paths through time and
      space.</p>

    <p>
      Floor holds Table holds Saucer holds Cup holds Tea Wheel turns Shaft
      turns Gear turns Shaft turns Gear Sometimes we even chain together
      different kinds of links:</p>

    <p>
      House walk to Garage drive to Airport fly to Airport Owls are Birds,
      and Birds can Fly. So, Owls can Fly.</p>

    <p>
      The chain containing <em>walk,</em> <em>drive,</em> and <em>fly</em>
      may appear to use several different kinds of links. But although
      they differ in regard to vehicles, they all refer to paths through
      space. And in the Owl-Bird example, <em>are</em> and <em>can</em>
      seem more different at first, but we can translate them both into a
      more uniform language by changing <em>Owls are Birds</em>
      into <em>An Owl is a Typical-Bird</em> and <em>Birds can Fly</em>
      into <em>A Typical-Bird is a thing-which-can-Fly.</em> Both
      sentences then share the same type of <em>is a</em> link, and this
      allows us to chain them together more easily.</p>

    <p>
      For generations, scientists and philosophers have tried to explain
      ordinary reasoning in terms of logical principles &mdash; with
      virtually no success. I suspect this enterprise failed because it
      was looking in the wrong direction: common sense works so well not
      because it is an approximation of logic; logic is only a small part
      of our great accumulation of different, useful ways to chain things
      together. Many thinkers have assumed that logical necessity lies at
      the heart of our reasoning. But for the purposes of psychology,
      we&#39;d do better to set aside the dubious ideal of faultless
      deduction and try, instead, to understand how people actually deal
      with what is usual or typical. To do this, we often think in terms
      of causes, similarities, and dependencies. What do all these forms
      of thinking share? They all use different ways to make chains.</p>
