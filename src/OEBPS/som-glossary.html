    <p>
      Because I thought this theory of the mind might interest not only
      specialists but everyone who thinks, I favored ordinary words over
      the technical language of psychology. This was rarely any sacrifice
      because so many psychological terms already stood for obsolete
      ideas.  But since I also wished to speak to specialists, I tried to
      hide more technical ideas between the lines; I hope this second
      level does not show. However there still were certain points at
      which no ordinary words seemed satisfactory, and I had to invent new
      terms or assign new meanings to old ones.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="accumulation">Accumulation</h3>
      (<a href="som-12.6.html">12.6</a>) A type of learning based on
      collecting examples of an idea without attempting to describe
      what they have in common. Contrast
      with <a href="#uniframe">Uniframe</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="agency">Agency</h3> (<a href="som-1.6.html">1.6</a>) Any assembly of
      parts considered in terms of what it can accomplish as a unit,
      without regard to what each of its parts does by itself.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="agent">Agent</h3> (<a href="som-1.4.html">1.4</a>) Any
      part or process of the mind that by itself is simple enough to
      understand &mdash; even though the interactions among groups of
      such agents may produce phenomena that are much harder to
      understand.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</h3>
      (<a href="som-7.4.html">7.4</a>) The field of research concerned
      with making machines do things that people consider to require
      intelligence. There is no clear boundary between psychology and
      Artificial Intelligence because the brain itself is a kind of
      machine. For an introduction to this field, I recommend Patrick
      Winston&#39;s textbook Artificial Intelligence, Addison-Wesley,
      1984.  For more connections with psychology, see Roger Schank
      and Kenneth Colby (eds.), Computer Models of Thought and
      Language, Freeman, 1973. Some influential early ideas about
      brains and machines can be seen in Warren McCulloch&#39;s
      Embodiments of Mind, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass.,
      1966. See <a href="#intelligence">Intelligence</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="attachment-learning">Attachment Learning</h3>
      (<a href="som-17.2.html">17.2</a>) The specific theory, proposed
      in this book, that the presence of someone to whom we are
      emotionally attached has a special effect on how we learn,
      especially in infancy. Attachment learning tends to cause us to
      modify our goals &mdash; rather than merely improve our methods
      for achieving the goals we already have.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="b-brain">B-Brain</h3> (<a href="som-6.4.html">6.4</a>)
      Any part of the brain connected not to the outside world, but
      only to another part of the same brain. Like a manager, a
      B-brain can supervise an A-brain without understanding either
      how the A-brain works or the problems with which the A-brain is
      involved &mdash; for example, by recognizing patterns of
      activity that indicate the A-brain is confused, wasting time in
      repetitive activity, or focused on an unproductive level of
      detail.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="block-arch">Block-Arch</h3> (<a href="som-12.1.html">12.1</a>) A
      scenario adapted from Patrick Winston&#39;s doctoral
      thesis, <em>Learning Structural Descriptions by Examples,</em>
      in <i>The Psychology of Computer Vision</i>, P. H. Winston
      (ed.), McGraw-Hill, 1975. The study of the world of
      children&#39;s building-blocks may at first seem childishly
      simple, but it has been one of the most productive areas of
      research about Artificial Intelligence, child psychology, and
      modern robotics engineering.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Censor</h3> (<a href="som-27.2.html">27.2</a>) An agent that
      inhibits or suppresses the operation of other agents. Censorlike
      agents are involved with how we learn from our mistakes. This
      idea played a prominent role in Freud&#39;s theories but has
      been virtually ignored by modern experimental psychologists
      &mdash; presumably because it is hard to study what people do
      not think. See Freud&#39;s 1905 book Jokes and Their Relation to
      the Unconscious. I suspect censorlike agents may constitute the
      larger part of human memory. The discussion of censors and jokes
      in chapter 27 is based on my essay <em>Jokes and Their Relation
      to the Cognitive Unconscious,</em> published in Cognitive
      Constraints on Communication, Representations and Processes,
      L. Vaina and J.K.K. Hintikka (eds.), . Reidel, 1981. See
      <a href="#suppressors">Suppressors</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Challenger, Professor</h3> (<a href="som-4.4.html">4.4</a>) A rival of mine, disguised as the
      treacherous archaeologist in Arthur Conan Doyle&#39;s novel The Lost
      World, who resembles Sherlock Holmes&#39;s nemesis, the mathematician
      Moriarty, except for being somewhat more honorable.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Closing the Ring</h3> (<a href="som-19.10.html">19.10</a>) A technique by which an agency can recall many
      details of a memory from being given only a few <em>cues.</em></p>

    <p>
      <h3>Common Sense</h3> (<a href="som-1.5.html">1.5</a>) The mental skills that most people share.
      Commonsense thinking is actually more complex than many of the
      intellectual accomplishments that attract more attention and respect,
      because the mental skills we call <em>expertise</em> often engage large
      amounts of knowledge but usually employ only a few types of
      representations. In contrast, common sense involves many different kinds
      of representations and thus requires a larger range of different skills.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Computer Science</h3> (<a href="som-6.8.html">6.8</a>) A
      science still in its infancy. While other sciences study how
      particular types of objects interact, computer science studies
      how interactions work in general &mdash; that is, how societies
      of parts can accomplish what those parts cannot do
      separately. Although computer science began with the study of
      serial computers &mdash; that is, of machines that could do only
      one thing at a time &mdash; it has grown to the point of
      studying the sorts of interconnected networks of processes that
      must go on inside societies of mind. (For an introduction to the
      theory of single-process machines, see my book <i>Computation:
      Finite and Infinite Machines</i>, Prentice-Hall, 1967.)</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Consciousness</h3> (<a href="som-6.1.html">6.1</a>) In this
      book, the word is used mainly for the myth that human minds
      are <em>self-aware</em> in the sense of perceiving what happens
      inside themselves. I maintain that human consciousness can never
      represent what is occurring at the present moment, but only a
      little of the recent past &mdash; partly because each agency has
      a limited capacity to represent what happened recently and
      partly because it takes time for agencies to communicate with
      one another. Consciousness is peculiarly hard to describe
      because each attempt to examine temporary memories distorts the
      very records it is trying to inspect. The description of
      consciousness in section <a href="som-6.1.html">6.1</a> was
      adapted from my epilogue to Vernor Vinge&#39;s novel <i>True Names</i>,
      Bluejay Books, New York, 1984.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Context</h3> (<a href="som-20.2.html">20.2</a>) The effect upon one&#39;s state of mind of all the
      influences present at the time. At each moment, the context within which
      each agency works is determined by the activity of the nemes that reach
      that agency. See <a href="#neme">Neme</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Cross-Exclusion</h3> (<a href="som-16.4.html">16.4</a>) An arrangement in which each of several agents is
      connected so as to inhibit all the others &mdash; so that only one of
      them can remain active at a time.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Cross-Realm Correspondence</h3> (<a href="som-29.4.html">29.4</a>) A structure that has useful
      applications in two or more different mental realms. Such
      correspondences sometimes enable us to transfer knowledge and skill from
      one domain to another &mdash; without needing to accumulate experience
      in that other realm. This is the basis of certain important kinds of
      analogies and metaphors.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Creativity</h3> (<a href="som-7.10.html">7.10</a>) The myth that the production of novel ideas, artistic
      or otherwise, comes from some distinctive form of thought. I recommend
      the discussion of this subject in the chapter
      <em>Variations on a Theme as the Crux of Creativity,</em> in Douglas
      Hofstadter&#39;s <i>Metamagical Themas</i>, Basic Books, 1985.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Default Assumption</h3>
      (<a href="som-8.5.html">8.5</a>, <a href="som-12.12.html">12.12</a>)
      The kind of assumption we make when we lack reasons to think
      otherwise. For example, we assume <em>by default</em> that an
      unfamiliar individual who belongs to a familiar class will think
      and act like a <em>typical</em> member of that class. Default
      assumptions are more than mere conveniences; they constitute our
      most productive way to make generalizations. Although such
      assumptions are frequently wrong, they usually do little harm
      because they are automatically displaced when more specific
      information becomes available. However, they can do incalculable
      harm when they are held too rigidly.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Demon</h3> (<a href="som-27.1.html">27.1</a>) An agent that
      constantly watches for a certain condition and intervenes when
      it occurs. Our discussion of demons is partly based on Eugene
      Charniak&#39;s doctoral thesis,
      <em>Toward a Model of Children&#39;s Story Comprehension,</em>
      MIT, 1972.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Difference-Engine</h3> (<a href="som-7.8.html">7.8</a>) An
      agency whose actions tend to make the present state of affairs
      more like some goal or <em>desired state</em> whose description
      is represented in that agency. This idea was developed by Allen
      Newell, C. J. Shaw, and Herbert A. Simon into an important
      theory about human problem solving. See G.  Ernst and Allen
      Newell, <i>GPS, A Case Study in Generality and Problem
      Solving</i>, Academic Press, 1969.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Direction-Neme</h3> (<a href="som-24.6.html">24.6</a>) An
      agent associated with a particular direction or region in
      space. I suspect that bundles of direction-nemes are used inside
      our brains for representing not only spatial locations and
      directions, but also for representing many nonspatial
      concepts. Direction-nemes resemble isonomes in spatial realms
      but more resemble polynemes in other realms.
      See <a href="#interaction-square">Interaction-Square</a> and
      <a href="#frame-array">Frame-Array</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Distributed Memory</h3> (<a href="som-20.9.html">20.9</a>) A
      representation in which each fragment of information is stored,
      not by making a single, substantial change in one agent, but by
      making small changes in many different agents. Many theorists
      have been led to believe that the construction of distributed
      memory-systems must involve
      <em>nondigital</em> devices such as holograms; that this is not so was
      shown by P. J. Willshaw, 0. P. Buneman, and H. C.  Longuet-Higgins
      in <em>Non-Holographic Associative Memory,</em> Nature, 222, 1969. See
      <a href="#memorizers">Memorizers</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Duplication Problem</h3> (<a href="som-23.2.html">23.2</a>)
      The question of how a mind could compare two similar ideas
      without possessing two identical agencies for representing both
      of them at the same time. This problem was never recognized in
      older theories of psychology, and I suspect it will be the
      downfall of most <em>holistic</em> theories of higher-level
      thought. See <a href="#time-blinking">Time Blinking</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Emotion</h3> (<a href="som-16.1.html">16.1</a>) A term used
      for too many different purposes. There is a popular view that
      emotions are inherently more complex and harder to understand
      than other aspects of human thought. I maintain that infantile
      emotions are comparatively simple in character and that the
      complexity of adult emotions results from accumulating networks
      of mutual exploitations. In adults, these networks eventually
      become indescribably complicated, but no more so than the
      networks of our adult <em>intellectual</em> structures.  Beyond
      a certain point, to distinguish between the emotional and
      intellectual structures of an adult is merely to describe the
      same structures from different points of view. See
      <a href="#proto-specialist">Proto-specialist</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Exploitation</h3> (<a href="som-4.5.html">4.5</a>) The act of one agency making use of the activity of
      another agency, without understanding how it works.  Exploitation is the
      most usual relationship among agencies because it is so difficult for
      them to understand one another.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Exception Principle</h3> (<a href="som-12.9.html">12.9</a>) The concept that it may not pay to change a
      well-established skill in order to accommodate an exception.  The more
      one builds upon a certain foundation, the greater the disruption upon
      changing it. A system&#39;s growth will tend to cease, past the point at
      which the damage caused by any change outweighs the immediate gain. See
      <a href="#investment-principle">Investment Principle</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Frame</h3> (<a href="som-24.2.html">24.2</a>) A
      representation based on a set of terminals to which other
      structures can be attached. Normally, each terminal is connected
      to a default assumption, which is easily displaced by more
      specific information. Other ideas about frames that are not
      discussed within this book were published in my chapter <em>A
      Framework for Representing Knowledge,</em> in Psychology of
      Computer Vision, P. H. Winston (ed.), McGraw-Hill,
      1975. See <a href="#picture-frames">Picture-Frames</a>, <a href="#trans-frame">Trans-frame</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Frame-Array</h3> (<a href="som-25.2.html">25.2</a>) A family
      of frames that share the same terminals.  Information attached
      to any terminal of a frame-array automatically becomes available
      to all the frames of that array.  This makes it easy to change
      perspective, not only in regard to a physical viewpoint, but in
      other mental realms as well.  Frame-arrays are often controlled
      by bundles of direction-nemes.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Functional Autonomy</h3> (<a href="som-17.4.html">17.4</a>)
      The idea that specific goals can lead to subgoals of broader
      character. For example, in order to please another individual, a
      child might develop more general goals of acquiring knowledge,
      power, or wealth &mdash; yet the very same subgoals might serve
      equally well an initial wish to injure that other
      individual. The term <em>functional autonomy</em> derives from
      Gordon Allport, who was one of my professors at Harvard.</p>
    <p>
      <h3>Functional Definition</h3>
      (<a href="som-12.4.html">12.4</a>) Specifying something in terms
      of how it might be used, rather than in terms of its parts and
      their
      relationships. See <a href="#structural-definition">Structural
      Definition</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Generate and Test</h3> (<a href="som-7.3.html">7.3</a>)
      Solving a problem by trial and error &mdash; that is, by
      proposing solutions recklessly, then rejecting those that do not
      work.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Genius</h3> (<a href="som-7.10.html">7.10</a>) An individual of
      prodigious mental accomplishment.  Although even the most
      outstanding human prodigies rarely develop even twice as quickly
      as their peers, many people feel that their existence demands a
      special explanation. I suspect that the answer is to be found
      not in the superficial skills such people learn, but in the
      early accidents that lead them into learning better ways to
      learn.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Goal</h3> (<a href="som-7.8.html">7.8</a>) The representation in a difference-engine of an imagined
      final state of affairs. This definition of goal may at first seem too
      impersonal because it does not explain either the elation that comes
      with achieving a human goal or the frustration that accompanies
      failure. However, we should not expect to explain such complicated
      phenomena of adult psychology directly in terms of simple principles,
      since they also depend on many other aspects of our mental
      architecture. Basing our concept of goal on the difference-engine idea
      helps us to avoid the single-agent fallacy by permitting us to speak
      about a goal without needing to refer to the person who entertains that
      goal; a person&#39;s many agencies may each have different goals &mdash;
      without that person being <em>aware</em> of them.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Grammar-Tactic</h3> (<a href="som-22.10.html">22.10</a>) An
      operation involved with speech that corresponds to a step in a
      process of constructing a mental representation. Grammar-tactics
      are not the same as <em>grammar rules,</em> although these have
      a close relation. The difference is that grammar rules are both
      superficial and subjective &mdash; in the sense that they
      purport to describe regularities in one person&#39;s behavior as
      observed by someone else &mdash; while grammar-tactics are
      objective in the sense that they are defined to be the
      underlying processes that actually produce speech. Although it
      may be more difficult to discover just what those processes do,
      it is better to speculate on how language is produced and used
      than merely to describe its observed, external forms.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Homunculus</h3> (<a href="som-5.2.html">5.2</a>) Literally, a tiny person. In psychology, the
      unproductive and paradoxical idea that a person&#39;s behavior depends
      upon the behavior of another personlike entity located deeper inside
      that person.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="interaction-square">Interaction-Square</h3>
      (<a href="som-14.9.html">14.9</a>) The idea of representing the
      interaction between two processes by linking pairs of examples
      to direction-nemes. We can use this same technique not only for
      representing spatial relationships, but for causal, temporal,
      and many other kinds of interactions. This makes the
      interaction-square idea a powerful scheme for representing
      cross-realm correspondences.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Interaction</h3> (<a href="som-2.1.html">2.1</a>) The effect
      of one part of a system upon another part.  It is remarkable
      that in the history of science virtually all phenomena have
      eventually been explained in terms of interactions between parts
      taken two at a time. For example, Newton&#39;s law of gravity,
      which describes the mutual attraction of two particles, enables
      us to predict the motions of all the planets, stars, and
      galaxies &mdash; without any need to consider three or more
      objects at a time! One could conceive of a universe in which
      whenever three stars formed an equilateral triangle, one of them
      would instantly disappear &mdash; but virtually no three-part
      interactions have ever been observed in the physical world.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Interruption</h3> (<a href="som-15.9.html">15.9</a>) A term
      used in this book to refer to any process that can be suspended
      while the agency involved can do some other job &mdash; yet
      later return to where it left off. The ability to do this
      requires some sort of temporary
      memory. See <a href="#recursion-principle">Recursion
      Principle</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Intelligence</h3> (<a href="som-7.1.html">7.1</a>) A term frequently
      used to express the myth that some single entity or element is
      responsible for the quality of a person&#39;s ability to
      reason. I prefer to think of this word as representing not any
      particular power or phenomenon, but simply all the mental skills
      that, at any particular moment, we admire but don&#39;t yet
      understand.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Introspection</h3> (<a href="som-6.5.html">6.5</a>) The myth
      that our minds possess the ability directly to perceive or
      apprehend their own operations.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Intuition</h3> (<a href="som-12.10.html">12.10</a>) The myth that the mind possesses some immediate (and
      hence inexplicable) abilities to solve problems or perceive truths. This
      belief is based on naive views of how we get ideas.  For example, we
      often experience a moment of excitement or exhilaration at the moment of
      completing a complex and pro longed but nonconscious analysis of a
      problem. The myth of intuition wrongly attributes the solution to what
      happened in that final moment. As for being able directly to apprehend
      what is true, we simply forget how frequently our <em>intuitions</em>
      turn out wrong.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Investment Principle</h3> (<a href="som-14.6.html">14.6</a>)
      The tendency of any well-developed skill to retard the growth of
      similar skills because the latter work less well in their early
      forms &mdash; and hence are used so infrequently that they never
      reach maturity. Because of this, we tend to invest most of our
      time and effort on elaborating a comparatively few techniques,
      rather than on accumulating many different ones. This can lead,
      at the same time, both to the formation of a coherent and
      effective personal style and to a decline in flexibility that
      may be wrongly attributed to
      aging. See <a href="#exception-principle">Exception
      Principle</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Isonome</h3> (<a href="som-22.1.html">22.1</a>) A signal or
      pathway in the brain that has similar effects on several
      different agencies.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>K-Line</h3> (<a href="som-8.1.html">8.1</a>) The theory that
      certain kinds of memories are based on turning on sets of agents
      that reactivate one&#39;s previous partial mental states. This
      idea was first described in my essay <em>K-lines: A Theory of
      Memory,</em> Cognitive Science, 4 (2), April 1980.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Learning</h3> (<a href="som-7.5.html">7.5</a>) An omnibus
      word for all the processes that lead to long-term changes in our
      minds.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Level-Band</h3> (<a href="som-8.5.html">8.5</a>) The idea that a typical mental process tends to
      operate, at each moment, only within a certain range or portion of the
      structure of each agency. This makes it possible for one process to work
      on small details without disrupting other processes that are concerned
      with large-scale plans.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Logical Thinking</h3> (<a href="som-18.1.html">18.1</a>) The
      popular but unsound theory that much of human reasoning proceeds
      in accord with clear-cut rules that lead to foolproof
      conclusions. In my view, we employ logical reasoning only in
      special forms of adult thought, which are used mainly to
      summarize what has already been discovered. Most of our ordinary
      mental work &mdash; that is, our commonsense reasoning &mdash;
      is based more on <em>thinking by analogy</em> &mdash; that is,
      applying to our present circumstances our representations of
      seemingly similar previous experiences.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Memorizer</h3> (<a href="som-19.5.html">19.5</a>) An agent
      that can reset an agency into some previously useful state. See
      <a href="#recognizer">Recognizer</a>
      and <a href="#distributed-memory">Distributed Memory</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Memory</h3> (<a href="som-15.3.html">15.3</a>) An omnibus
      term for a great many structures and processes that have
      ill-defined boundaries in both everyday and technical
      psychology; these include what we call
      <em>re-membering,</em> <em>re-collecting,</em> <em>re-minding,</em> and
      <em>recognizing.</em> This book suggests that what these share in common
      is their involvement with how we reproduce our former partial mental
      states.</p>
      
      <p><h3>Mental State</h3> (<a href="som-8.4.html">8.4</a>) The
      condition of activity of a group of agents at a certain
      moment. In this book we have assumed that every agent, at any
      moment, is either completely aroused or completely quiescent; in
      other words, we ignore the possibility of different degrees of
      arousal. This kind of <em>two-state</em> or <em>digital</em>
      assumption is characteristic of computer science and, at first,
      may seem too simplistic. However, experience has shown that the
      so-called analog theories that are alleged to be more realistic
      quickly become so complicated that, in the end, the simpler
      two-state models actually lead to deeper understandings &mdash;
      at least about basic
      principles. See <a href="#partial-mental-state">Partial Mental
      State</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Metaphor</h3> (<a href="som-29.8.html">29.8</a>) The myth
      that there is a clear distinction between representations that
      are <em>realistic</em> and those that are merely suggestive. In
      their book Metaphors We Live By, University of Chicago Press,
      1980, Mark Johnson and George Lakoff demonstrate that metaphor
      is no mere special device of literary expression but permeates
      virtually every aspect of human thought.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Micromemory</h3> (<a href="som-15.8.html">15.8</a>) The
      smallest components of our short-term memory-systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>Microneme</h3> (<a href="som-20.5.html">20.5</a>) A neme
      involved with agents at a relatively low
      level. See <a href="#neme">Neme</a>.</p>
    <p>
      <h3>Model</h3> (<a href="som-30.3.html">30.3</a>) Any structure
      that a person can use to simulate or anticipate the behavior of
      something else.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="neme">Neme</h3> (<a href="som-25.6.html">25.6</a>) An
      agent whose output represents a fragment of an idea or state of
      mind. The <em>context</em> within which a typical agent works is
      largely determined by the activity of the nemes that reach it. I
      called nemes <em>C-lines</em> in <em>Plain Talk About Neuro-
      developmental Epistemology,</em> in Proceedings of the Fifth
      International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,
      Cambridge, Mass., 1977; the description in section 20. 5 is also
      based on the idea of <em>microfeature</em> developed by David
      L.Waltz and Jordan Pollack in <em>Massively Parallel
      Parsing,</em> Cognitive Science, 9 (1).</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="nome">Nome</h3> (<a href="som-25.6.html">25.6</a>) An
      agent whose outputs affect an agency in some predetermined
      manner, such as a pronome, isonome, or paranome; an agent whose
      effect depends more on genetic architecture than on learning
      from experience. The suffix -nome was chosen to suggest an
      atom-like, unchanging quality.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="noncompromise-principle">Noncompromise Principle</h3>
      (<a href="som-3.2.html">3.2</a>) The idea that when two agencies
      conflict it may be better to ignore them both and yield control
      to yet another, independent agency.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="papert's-principle">Papert&#39;s Principle</h3>
      (<a href="som-10.4.html">10.4</a>) The hypothesis that many
      steps in mental growth are based less on the acquisition of new
      skills than on building new administrative systems for managing
      already established abilities.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="paranome">Paranome</h3>
      (<a href="som-29.3.html">29.3</a>) An agent that operates on
      agencies of several different mental realms at once, with
      similar effects on all of them.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="partial-mental-state">Partial Mental State</h3>
      (<a href="som-8.4.html">8.4</a>) A description of the state of
      activity of some particular group of mental agents. This
      technical but simple idea makes it easy to understand how one
      can entertain and combine several ideas at the same time. See
      <a href="#mental-state">Mental State</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="perceptron">Perceptron</h3>
      (<a href="som-19.7.html">19.7</a>) A type of recognition machine
      that learns to weigh evidence. Invented by Frank Rosenblatt in
      the late 1950s, Perceptrons use singularly simple procedures for
      learning which weights to assign to various fragments of
      evidence. Seymour Papert and I analyzed this type of machine in
      the book <i>Perceptrons</i>, MIT Press, 1969, and showed that
      the simplest kinds of Perceptrons cannot do very much by
      themselves. However, they can do much more when arranged into
      societies so that some of them can then learn to recognize
      relations among the patterns recognized by the others. It seems
      quite likely that some types of brain cells use similar
      principles.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="picture-frames">Picture-Frames</h3>
      (<a href="som-24.7.html">24.7</a>) A type of frame whose
      terminals are controlled by direction-nemes. Picture-frames are
      particularly suited to representing certain kinds of spatial
      information.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="polyneme">Polyneme</h3>
      (<a href="som-19.5.html">19.5</a>) An agent that arouses
      different activities, at the same time, in different agencies
      &mdash; as a result of learning from experience. Contrast with
      <a href="#isonome">Isonome</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="pronome">Pronome</h3> (<a href="som-21.1.html">21.1</a> ) A type of agent associated with a
      particular <em>role</em> or aspect of a representation &mdash;
      corresponding, for example, to the Actor, Trajectory, or Cause of some
      action. Pronome agents frequently control the attachments of terminals
      of frames to other frames; to do this, a pronome must possess some
      temporary memory.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="proto-specialist">Proto-specialist</h3>
      (<a href="som-16.3.html">16.3</a>) One of the genetically
      constructed subsystems responsible for some of an
      animal&#39;s <em>instinctive</em> behavior.  Large portions of
      our minds start out as almost separate proto-specialists, and we
      interpret their activity as manifesting different, primitive
      emotions. Later, as agencies become more interconnected and
      learn to exploit one another, these differences grow less
      distinct. This conception is based on the societylike theory
      proposed by Niko Tinbergen in The Study of Instinct, Oxford
      University Press, 1951.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="puzzle-principle">Puzzle Principle</h3>
      (<a href="som-7.3.html">7.3</a>) The idea that any problem can
      be solved by trial and error &mdash; provided one already has
      some way to recognize a solution when one is
      found. See <a href="#generate-and-test">Generate and
      Test</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="mental-realm">Realm, Mental</h3>
      (<a href="som-29.1.html">29.1</a>) A division of the mind that
      deals with some distinct variety of concern by using distinct
      mechanisms and representations.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="recognizer">Recognizer</h3>
      (<a href="som-19.6.html">19.6</a>) An agent that becomes active
      in response to a particular pattern of input signals.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="recursion-principle">Recursion Principle</h3>
      ( <a href="som-15.11.html">15.11</a> ) The idea that no society,
      however large, can overcome every limitation &mdash; unless it
      has some way to reuse the same agents, over and over again, for
      different purposes. See <a href="#interruption">Interruption</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="reformulation">Reformulation</h3>
      (<a href="som-13.1.html">13.1</a>) Replacing one representation
      of something by another, different type of representation.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="representation">Representation</h3>
      (<a href="som-21.6.html">21.6</a>) A structure that can be used
      as a substitute for something else, for a certain purpose, as
      one can use a map as a substitute for an actual city. See
      <a href="#functional-definition">Functional Definition</a> and
      <a href="#model">Model</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3>Re-duplication Theory of Speech</h3>
      (<a href="som-22.10.html">22.10</a>) My conjecture about what
      happens when a speaker explains an idea to a listener. A
      difference-enginelike process tries to construct a second copy
      of the idea&#39;s representation inside the speaker&#39;s
      mind. Each mental operation used in the course of that
      duplication process activates a corresponding grammar-tactic in
      the language- agency, and these lead to a stream of speech. This
      will result in communication to the extent that suitably matched
      <em>inverse grammar-tactics</em> construct, inside the listener&#39;s
      mind, an equivalent representation.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="script">Script</h3> (<a href="som-13.5.html">13.5</a>)
      A sequence of actions produced so automatically that it can be
      performed without disturbing the activities of many other
      agencies. The action script in
      section <a href="som-21.7.html">21.7</a> accomplishes this by
      eliminating all the higher-level managers like Put and Get. A
      script-based skill tends to be inflexible because it lacks
      bureaucracy; one gains speed by removing higher-level anchor
      points but loses access to alternatives when things go wrong;
      script-based experts run the risk of becoming inarticulate. The
      book by Roger Schank and Robert Abelson, Scripts, Goals, Plans
      and Understanding, Erlbaum Associates, 1977, speculates about
      the human use of scripts.</p>

    <p>
     <h3 name="self">Self</h3> (<a href="som-4.1.html">4.1</a>) In
      this book, when written <em>Self,</em> the myth that each of us
      contains some special part that embodies the essence of the
      mind. When written as <em>self,</em> the word has the ordinary
      sense of a person&#39;s individuality. See <a href="#single-agent-fallacy">Single-Agent
      Fallacy</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="single-agent-fallacy">Single-Agent Fallacy</h3>
      (<a href="som-4.1.html">4.1</a>) The idea that a person&#39;s
      thought, will, decisions, and actions originate in some single
      center of control, instead of emerging from the activity of
      complex societies of processes.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="simulation">Simulation</h3>
      (<a href="som-2.4.html">2.4</a>) A situation in which one system
      mimics the behavior of another. In principle, a modern computer
      can be used to simulate any other kind of machine. This is
      important for psychology, because in the past, there was usually
      no way for scientists to confirm their expectations about the
      consequences of a complicated theory or mechanism. The theories
      in this book have not yet been simulated, partly because they
      are not specified clearly enough and partly because the older
      computers lacked enough capacity and speed to simulate enough
      agents.  Such machines have recently become available; for an
      example, see W. Daniel Hillis&#39;s doctoral thesis, <em>The
      Connection Machine,</em> MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1985.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="simulus">Simulus</h3>
      (<a href="som-16.8.html">16.8</a>) An illusion that a certain
      thing is present, caused by a process that evokes, at higher
      levels of the mind, a state resembling the state of mind that
      would be caused by that thing&#39;s actual presence. (A new
      word. )</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="society">Society</h3> (<a href="som-1.1.html">1.1</a>)
      In this book, an organization of parts of a mind. I reserved the
      term <em>community</em> for referring to organizations of people
      because I did not want to suggest that a human mind resembles a
      human community in any particular way.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="society-of-more">Society of More</h3>
      (<a href="som-10.2.html">10.2</a>) The agents used by a mind to

    <p>
      <h3 name="stage-of-development">Stage of Development</h3>
      (<a href="som-16.2.html">16.2</a>) An episode in the growth of a
      mind.  <a href="som-17.html">Chapter 17</a> offers several
      reasons why complicated systems tend to grow in sequences of
      episodes, rather than through processes of steady change.</p>

      </p><p>
      <h3 name="suppressor">Suppressor</h3>
      (<a href="som-27.2.html">27.2</a>) A censorlike agent that works
      by disrupting a mental state that has already
      occurred. Suppressors are easier to construct than censors, and
      require less memory, but are much less efficient.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="time-blinking">Time Blinking</h3>
      (<a href="som-23.3.html">23.3</a>) Finding differences between
      two mental states by activating them in rapid succession and
      noticing which agents change their states. I suspect it is by
      using this method that our brains avoid the duplication problem
      mentioned in section <a href="som-23.2.html">23.2</a>.  Time
      blinking might be one of the synchronized activities of brain
      cells that gives rise to <em>brain waves.</em></p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="trajectory">Trajectory</h3>
      (<a href="som-21.6.html">21.6</a>) Literally, the path or route
      of an action or activity.  However, we use this word not only
      for a path in space, but, by analogy, for other realms of
      thought. See <a href="#pronome">Pronome</a>.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="trans-frame">Trans-Frame</h3>
      (<a href="som-21.3.html">21.3</a>) A particular type of frame
      that is centered around the trajectory between two situations,
      one for <em>before</em> and the other for <em>after.</em> The
      theories in this book about Trans-frames owe much to Roger
      Schank. See his book, <i>Conceptual Information Processing</i>,
      North-Holland, 1975.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="unconscious">Unconscious</h3>
      (<a href="som-17.10.html">17.10</a>) A term often used, in
      common-sense psychology, to refer to areas of thought that are
      actively barred or censored against introspection. In this book
      we take <em>conscious</em> to mean aspects of our mental
      activity of which we are aware.  But since there are very few
      such processes, we must consider virtually everything done by
      the mind to be unconscious.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="uniframe">Uniframe</h3>
      (<a href="som-12.3.html">12.3</a>) A description designed to

      used to distinguish them from other things.</p>

    <p>
      <h3 name="freedom-of-will">Will, Freedom of</h3>
      (<a href="som-30.6.html">30.6</a>) The myth that human volition
      is based upon some third alternative to either causality or
      chance.</p>
