<h2>15.7 memory rearrangements</h2>

    <p>
      Let&#39;s return to moving mental furniture. What would we need to
      imagine moving things around a room? First we&#39;d need some way to
      represent how objects are arranged in space. In our Block-Arch
      scenario, the scene was represented in terms of the shapes of the
      objects and the relations between them. In the case of a room scene,
      you might also relate each object to the walls and corners of the
      room; you might notice that the couch is about midway between a
      table and a chair, and that all three are lined up near a certain
      wall.</p>

    <p>
      Once we have a method for representing rooms, we also need
      techniques for manipulating these representations. How could we
      envision the result of exchanging that couch and chair? Let&#39;s
      oversimplify, and suppose that this can he done simply by exchanging
      the states of two agencies &mdash; an agency A, which represents the
      couch, and another agency B, which represents the chair. To exchange
      these states, let&#39;s assume that both agencies have access to
      two <em>short-term memory-units,</em> called M-1 and M-2, which can
      record the states of agencies. Then we can exchange the states of A
      and B, first by storing away the states A and B, and then by
      restoring them in reverse order.  In other words, we could use the
      following simple four-step <em>script</em>:</p>

    <p>
      1. Store the state of A in M-1.  2. Store the state of B in M-2.
      3. Use M-2 to determine the state of A.  4. Use M-1 to determine the
      state of B.</p>

    <p>
      A <em>memory-control script</em> like this can work only if we have
      memory-units that are small enough to pick out couch-sized portions
      of the larger scene. M-1 and M-2 would not do the job if they could
      store only descriptions of entire rooms. In other words, we have to
      be able to connect our short-term memories only to appropriate
      aspects of our current problems. Learning such abilities is not
      simple, and perhaps it is a skill some people never really
      master. What if we wanted to rearrange three or more objects? As a
      matter of fact, it is possible to produce any rearrangement
      whatsoever, using only operations that exchange two objects at a
      time! When you approach an unfamiliar kind of problem, it&#39;s best
      to start by making only one or two changes at a time. Then, in the
      course of becoming an expert, you discover schemes that make several
      useful changes in memory at once.</p>

    <p>
      Our pair-exchanging script needs more machinery. Because each
      memory-unit must wait until the previous step is finished, the
      timing of each script step may have to depend on
      various <em>condition sensors.</em> Shortly we&#39;ll see that even
      this is not enough to solve hard problems: our memory-control
      processes also need ways to interrupt themselves while they call on
      other agencies or memories for help.  Indeed, the problems we must
      solve when managing our memories are surprisingly like those we face
      when dealing with things in the outside world.</p>
