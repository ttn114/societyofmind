<h2>28.4 mind over matter</h2>

    <p>
      It seems completely natural to us that we should feel pain when
      we&#39;re injured or hunger when we&#39;re deprived of food. Such
      feelings seem to us to be inherent in those predicaments. Then why
      doesn&#39;t a car feel pain when its tire is punctured or feel
      hungry when its fuel runs low?  The answer is that pain and hunger
      are not inherent in being injured or starved: such feelings must
      be <em>engineered.</em> These physical circumstances do not directly
      produce the states of mind they arouse; on the contrary, this
      depends upon intricate networks of agencies and nerve-bundles that
      took millions of years to evolve. We have no conscious sense of that
      machinery. When your skin is touched, it seems as though it were
      your skin that feels &mdash; and not your brain &mdash; because
      you&#39;re unaware of everything that happens in between.</p>

    <p>
      In order for hunger to keep us fed, it must engage some agency that
      gives priority to food-acquiring goals. But unless such signals came
      before our fuel reserves were entirely gone, they&#39;d arrive too
      late to have any use. This is why feeling hungry or tired is not the
      same as being genuinely starved or exhausted. To serve as
      useful <em>warning signs,</em> feelings like pain and hunger must be
      engineered not simply to indicate dangerous conditions, but to
      anticipate them and warn us before too much damage is done.</p>

    <p>
      But what about the feelings of depression and discouragement we get
      when stuck at boring jobs or with problems we cannot solve? Such
      feelings resemble those that accompany physical fatigue, but they do
      not signify genuine depletions because they often easily respond to
      changes of context, interest, and schedule. Nevertheless, the
      similarity would be no accident, for probably those feelings arise
      because our higher-level brain centers have evolved connections that
      exploit our ancient fuel-exhaustion warning systems. After all, the
      unproductive use of time is virtually equivalent to wasting hard-
      earned energy!</p>

    <p>
      Now what about those incidents in which some person seems to go
      beyond what we supposed were the normal bounds of endurance,
      strength, or tolerance of pain? We like to believe this demonstrates
      that the force of will can overrule the physical laws that govern
      the world. But a person&#39;s ability to persist in circumstances we
      hadn&#39;t thought were tolerable need not indicate anything
      supernatural.  Since our feelings of pain, depression, exhaustion,
      and discouragement are themselves mere products of our minds&#39;
      activities &mdash; and ones that are engineered to warn us before we
      reach our ultimate limits &mdash; we need no extraordinary power of
      mind over matter to overcome them. It is merely a matter of finding
      ways to rearrange our priorities.</p>

    <p>
      In any case, what hurts &mdash; and even what is <em>felt</em> at
      all &mdash; may, in the end, be more dependent upon culture than
      biology. Ask anyone who runs a marathon, or ask your favorite
      Amazon.</p>
