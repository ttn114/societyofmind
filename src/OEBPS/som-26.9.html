<h2>26.9 language and vision</h2>

    <p>
      Some language scholars seem to think that what we do in language is
      unique, in the filling of frames with other frames to open up a
      universe of complicated structure-forms. But consider how frequently
      we do similarly complex things in understanding visual scenes. The
      language-agency must be able to interrupt itself, while handling one
      phrase, to work on parts of another phrase, and this involves some
      complex short-term memory skills. But in vision, too, there must be
      similar processes involved in breaking scenes apart and representing
      them as composed of objects and relationships. The picture below
      suggests how similar such processes may be. In language, the problem
      is to recognize that the two words <em>took</em> and <em>out</em>
      both belong to the same verb phrase, although they are separated in
      time. In vision, the problem is to recognize the two regions of a
      tabletop as being parts of the same object, although they are
      separated in space.</p>

    <p>
      Notice also that we cannot see the tops of the blocks that serve as
      legs &mdash; and yet we do not have the slightest doubt about where
      they end. Similarly, the ends of language phrases are frequently
      unmarked &mdash; yet again we can tell where they end. In <em>The
	thief who took the moon moved it to Paris,</em> the
      word <em>who</em> marks the beginning of a new frame, but there is
      no special word to indicate the ending of that phrase. Why don&#39;t
      we wrongly assign <em>the moon</em> to the Actor of the spurious
      phrase, <em>The moon moved it to Paris?</em> It is because we first
      heard <em>. . . who took the moon,</em> which caused <em>the
	moon</em> to get attached to the Object pronome of the Trans-frame
      for <em>took</em> &mdash; so now it&#39;s not available to serve as
      Actor in the frame for <em>moved.</em> <em>The thief</em> is still
      available to play that role. I don&#39;t mean to suggest we can
      never assign the same phrase to two different roles, only that good
      speakers choose their forms so that this doesn&#39;t happen by
      accident.</p>

    <p>
      Did our capacity to deal with phraselike structures evolve first in
      language or in vision? Among our ancestors, vision greatly antedates
      language, so if these abilities are related, our language-agencies
      themselves more likely evolved from variants of genes that first
      evolved in shaping the architecture of our vision-systems. Today we
      have no way to verify such a conjecture, but future geneticists may
      become able to trace the ancestry of many such relationships by
      examining the genes that generate the corresponding brain
      structures.</p>
