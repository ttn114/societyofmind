      Never speak more clearly than you think.
      <cite>&mdash;Jeremy Bernstein</cite>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
      This book assumes that any brain, machine, or other thing that has a
      mind must be composed of smaller things that cannot think at
      all. The structure of the book itself reflects this view: each page
      explores a theory or idea that exploits what other pages do. Some
      readers might prefer a more usual form of story plot. I tried to do
      that several times, but it never seemed to work; each way I tried to
      line things up left too many thoughts that would not fit. A mind is
      too complex to fit the mold of narratives that start out here and
      end up there; a human intellect depends upon the connections in a
      tangled web &mdash; which simply wouldn&#39;t work at all if it were
      neatly straightened out.</p>

    <p>
      Many psychologists dream of describing minds so economically that
      psychology would become as simple and precise as physics. But one
      must not confuse reality with dreams. It was not the ambitions of
      the physicists that made it possible to describe so much of the
      world in terms of so few and simple principles; that was because of
      the nature of our universe. But the operations of our minds do not
      depend on similarly few and simple laws, because our brains have
      accumulated many different mechanisms over aeons of evolution. This
      means that psychology can never be as simple as physics, and any
      simple theory of mind would be bound to miss most of the <em>big
	picture.</em> The science of psychology will be handicapped until we
      develop an overview with room for a great many smaller theories.</p>

    <p>
      To assemble the overview suggested in this book, I had to make
      literally hundreds of assumptions. Some scientists might object to
      this on the ground that successful sciences like physics and
      chemistry have found it more productive to develop theories that
      make the fewest assumptions, eliminating everything that does not
      seem absolutely essential. But until we have a more coherent
      framework for psychology, it will remain too early for the task of
      weeding out unproved hypotheses or for trying to show that one
      theory is better than another &mdash; since none of our present-day
      theories seem likely to survive very long in any case. Before we can
      have an image of the forest of psychology, we&#39;ll have to imagine
      more of its trees and restrain ourselves from simplifying them to
      death. Instead, we have to make ourselves complicated enough to deal
      with what is actually there.</p>

    <p>
      It is scarcely a century since people started to think effectively
      about the natures of the brainmachines that manufacture
      thoughts. Before that, those who tried to speculate about this were
      handicapped on one side by their failure to do experiments,
      particularly with young children, and on the other side by their
      lack of concepts for describing complicated machinery. Now, for the
      first time, mankind has accumulated enough conceptual tools to begin
      comprehending machines with thousands of parts. However, we are only
      beginning to deal with machines that have millions of parts and we
      have barely started to acquire the concepts that we&#39;ll need to
      understand the billion-part machines that constitute our brains. New
      kinds of problems always arise when one encounters systems built on
      larger, less familiar scales.</p>

    <p>
      Since most of the statements in this book are speculations, it would
      have been too tedious to mention this on every page. Instead, I did
      the opposite &mdash; by taking out all words like <em>possibly</em>
      and deleting every reference to scientific evidence. Accordingly,
      this book should be read less as a text of scientific scholarship
      and more as an adventure story for the imagination. Each idea should
      be seen not as a firm hypothesis about the mind, but as another
      implement to keep inside one&#39;s toolbox for making theories of
      the mind. Indeed, there is a sense in which that can be the only
      realistic way to think about psychology &mdash; since every
      particular person&#39;s mind develops as a huge machine that grows
      in a somewhat different way. Are minds machines? Of that, I&#39;ve
      raised no doubt at all but have only asked, what kind of machines?
      And though most people still consider it degrading to be regarded as
      machines, I hope this book will make them entertain, instead, the
      thought of how wonderful it is to be machines with such marvelous
      powers.</p>

    <p>
      Scientists like to credit those who first discovered each idea. But
      the central concept of this book, that the mind is a society of many
      smaller mechanisms, involved so many years of work to bring it to
      its present form that I can mention only a few of the people who had
      the most influence on it. In this research I shared the greatest
      privilege a human mind can have: to work on new ideas together with
      the foremost intellects of one&#39;s time. As a student at Harvard,
      I immersed myself in mathematics and psychology and attached myself
      to two great young scientists, the mathematician Andrew Gleason and
      the psychologist George A. Miller. This was the era of the
      scientific movement that was later called cybernetics, and I was
      especially entranced with the works of Nicholas Rashevsky and of
      Warren McCulloch, who were making the first theories of how
      assemblies of simple cell-machines could do such things as recognize
      objects and remember what they&#39;d seen. By the time I started
      graduate school in mathematics at Princeton in 1950, I had a clear
      enough idea about how to make a multi-agent learning machine. George
      Miller obtained funds for building it; this was the Snarc machine of
      chapter 7. Constructed with the help of a fellow student, Dean
      Edmonds, it managed to learn in certain ways, but its limitations
      convinced me that a more versatile <em>thinking machine</em> would
      have to exploit many other principles.</p>

    <p>
      My teachers in the golden age of mathematics at Princeton were not
      particularly interested in psychology, but the ways of thought are
      more important than the subject matter, and I learned new mental
      strategies from Albert Tucker, Ralph Fox, Solomon Lefshetz, John
      Tukey, Salomon Bochner, and John von Neumann. I learned even more
      from my own generation of students at Princeton: particularly from
      John Nash, Lloyd Shapley, Martin Shubik, and John McCarthy. In 1954
      I returned to Harvard as a Junior Fellow of the Harvard Society of
      Fellows, with no obligation but to pursue whatever goal seemed most
      important. There seemed no way to get around the apparent
      limitations of low-level, distributed-connection learning machines,
      so I turned toward a new theory being pioneered by Ray Solomonoff,
      about generalizing from experience. I attached myself to Warren
      McCulloch and Oliver Selfridge, with whom I worked most closely of
      all until becoming a professor of mathematics at MIT. It was from
      them that I derived my image of how to make a laboratory work.</p>

    <p>
      In 1959, John McCarthy came to MIT from Dartmouth, and we started
      the MIT Artificial Intelligence Project. We agreed that the most
      critical problem was of how minds do common-sense
      reasoning. McCarthy was more concerned with establishing logical and
      mathematical foundations for reasoning, while I was more involved
      with theories of how we actually reason using pattern recognition
      and analogy. This combination of theoretical and practical research
      attracted students of great ability, and our laboratory had an
      atmosphere that combined mathematical power with engineering
      adventure; this led not only to new theories of computation, but
      also to developing some of the very first automatic robots. In 1963,
      McCarthy left to start a new AI laboratory at Stanford, and now
      there were three principal centers of research in Artificial
      Intelligence, including the one that Allen Newell and Herbert Simon
      had started earlier at Carnegie-Mellon University. A fourth center
      soon emerged at Stanford Research Laboratory, and we all worked
      closely together.</p>

    <p>
      The money to support the people and equipment for this work came
      mainly from an office of the Advanced Research Projects Agency
      concerned with information processing technology. This office was
      directed, in effect, by the scientists themselves, initially by
      Dr. J.C.R.</p>

    <p>
      Licklider, who had been my teacher and friend when I was a student
      at Harvard. Licklider had already organized a research center at the
      Bolt, Beranek, and Newman company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and
      McCarthy and I and several of our students had worked closely with
      that group for several years. Later, when Licklider returned to
      become a professor at MIT, the Information Processing Technology
      Office was taken over successively by Lawrence G. Roberts and Ivan
      Sutherland (who had been students of ours at MIT) and then by Robert
      Taylor and Robert Kahn &mdash; all of whom made important
      intellectual contributions. The actual details of all these research
      contracts were managed in the Office of Naval Research by Marvin
      Denicoff, whose vision of the future had a substantial influence on
      the entire field. My own research was supported by the ONR over an
      even longer period, since it had previously financed my graduate
      studies in topology at Princeton, and, subsequently, Denicoff&#39;s
      successor, Alan Meyrowitz, supported my research during the
      completion of this book.</p>

    <p>
      Jerome Wiesner and Philip Morse of MIT obtained the resources for
      our first laboratory. Our development at MIT was encouraged by
      William Ted Martin, Norman Levinson, Witold Hurewicz, Norbert
      Weiner, Claude Shannon, Peter Elias, and Robert Fano. I was given
      the privilege of sharing with Shannon the endowed chair of Donner
      Professor of Science at MIT and enjoyed the support of many other
      people and organizations over the years: John Williams, Paul Armer,
      and Merril Flood enabled me to work with Newell, Shaw, and Simon at
      the Rand Corporation; Oliver Selfridge and Gerald Dinneen encouraged
      research at MIT&#39;s Lincoln Laboratory; Michel Gouilloud supported
      my work from the Schlumberger Corporation; Edward David provided
      support from Exxon; and Alan Kay supported many of our students with
      funding from (successively) the Xerox, Atari, and Apple
      corporations. For several years, the Thinking Machines Corporation
      has supported both this research and the development of a new type
      of computer called the Connection Machine &mdash; designed by my
      student Danny Hillis for embodying societies of mind.</p>

    <p>
      Most of all, I want to acknowledge the contributions to this book of
      Seymour Papert, who came to MIT in 1963 after five years of studying
      child development with Jean Piaget in Geneva. Papert and I worked so
      well together that for a decade we supervised the laboratory
      jointly, each able at any time to leave the other to decide what
      should be done. Together we evolved new mathematical techniques,
      designed laboratory experiments, built computer hardware and
      software, and supervised the same students. Such a partnership could
      not have worked so well had we not both developed in similar
      intellectual directions before we met; we were both involved with
      the same areas of mathematics, with similar concerns about
      machinery, and with similar attitudes about psychology. One of our
      projects was to build a machine that could see well enough to use
      mechanical hands for solving real-world problems; this was the
      origin of Builder and the insights that emerged from it. In trying
      to make that robot see, we found that no single method ever worked
      well by itself. For example, the robot could rarely discern an
      object&#39;s shape by using vision alone; it also had to exploit
      other types of knowledge about which kinds of objects were likely to
      be seen. This experience impressed on us the idea that only a
      society of different kinds of processes could possibly
      suffice. Papert and I worked together not only on robotic machines,
      but in many other areas; for example, we spent several years
      developing a new mathematical theory for the then mysterious
      Perceptron type of learning machine. In the middle 1970s Papert and
      I tried together to write a book about societies of mind but
      abandoned the attempt when it became clear that the ideas were not
      mature enough. The results of that collaboration shaped many earlier
      sections of this book.</p>

    <p>
      Eventually Papert and I both turned away from large-scale scientific
      enterprises toward somewhat different individual goals, and we
      imposed the directorship of our laboratory upon one of our most
      original and productive students, Patrick Winston &mdash; who first
      worked out the idea of making uniframes. Papert went on to develop a
      host of new theories about mental development and education; these
      led to the computer language LOGO and to many other concepts that
      started to enter the mainstream of educational thought over the next
      decade. I focused my concern on searching for better theories about
      the little world of how a child might learn to build with
      blocks. The parts of the puzzle that form this book began to fit
      together in my mind in the mid-1970s, around the concept of
      frame-array, and this eventually led to the theories about
      communication-lines, K-lines, and level-bands, and then, during the
      book&#39;s final stages, to the ideas about pronomes, polynemes, and
      cross-realm correspondences.</p>

    <p>
      As for the manuscript itself, Bradley Marx read through every draft,
      comparing each version with earlier ones, helping to maintain
      clarity, stylistic coherency, and especially protecting good ideas
      from destructive revisionary impulses. This was hard because the
      early manuscript was more than twice its present length. Robin
      Lakoff suggested neutering the English; this seemed at first
      impossible but soon became quite natural. Theodore Sturgeon reviewed
      an early draft; I wish he had lived to see it now. Kenneth Haase,
      Betty Dexter, and Tom Beckman made innumerable suggestions and
      corrections.  Successive drafts were reviewed by Danny Hillis, Steve
      Bagley, Marvin Denicoff, Charlotte Minsky, Michel Gouilloud, Justin
      Lieber, Philip Agre, David Wallace, Ben Kuipers, Peter de Jong, and
      Sona Vogel. Richard Feynman contributed a variety of insights about
      memory and parallel processing. David Yarmush helped to organize the
      book into sections, to smooth out the transitions, and to establish
      the gradient wherein the words begin with commonsense meanings and
      gradually become more technical. Bob Whittinghill made many
      suggestions about language as well as about psychology. Douglas
      Hofstadter evaluated the entire theory, forcing me to make several
      substantial changes. Michael Crichton made many technical
      suggestions and helped me to refine the early chapters.</p>

    <p>
      Russell Noftsker and Tom Callahan made substantial engineering
      contributions to our work. Hosts of ideas came from students at MIT,
      notably Howard Austin, Manuel Blum, Danny Bobrow, Eugene Charniak,
      Henry Ernst, Tom Evans, Scott Fahlman, Ira Goldstein, William
      Gosper, Richard Greenblatt, Adolfo Guzman, Kenneth Haase, William
      Henneman, Carl Hewitt, Danny Hillis, Jack Holloway, Tom Knight,
      William Martin, Joel Moses, Bertram Raphael, Larry Roberts, James
      Slagle, Jerry Sussman, Ivan Sutherland, David Waltz, Terry Winograd,
      Patrick Winston, and many others. Countless other thoughts came from
      working at various times with Maryann Amacher, Gregory Benford,
      Terry Beyer, Woodrow Bledsoe, Mortimer Casson, Edward Feigenbaum,
      Edward Fredkin, Arnold Griffith, Louis Hodes, Berthold Horn, Joel
      Isaacson, Russell Kirsch, David Kirsh, Robert Lawler, Justin Leiber,
      Douglas Lenat, Jerome Lettvin, David MacDonald, Curtis Marx, Hans
      Moravec, Stewart Nelson, Nils Nillsson, Donald Norman, Walter Pitts,
      Jerry Pournelle, Charles Rosen, Carl Sagan, Roger Schank,</p>

    <p>
      Robert Sheckley, Stephen Smoliar, Cynthia Solomon, Ray Solomonoff,
      Luc Steels, Warren Teitelman, and Graziella Tonfoni. I wish I could
      acknowledge the inspirations of all the friends of earlier years,
      particularly W. Ross Ashby, Thomas Etter, Ned Feder, Heinz von
      Foerster, Donald Hebb, John Hollander, Arnold Honig, Gordon Pask,
      Roland Silver, Jan Syrjala, Carroll Williams, Bertram Wolfe, David
      Yarmush &mdash; and of all the teachers of my youth, particularly
      Dudley Fitts, Ruth Gordon, Alexander Joseph, Edward Lepowsky, and
      Herbert Zim. My development was also strongly influenced first by
      the writing and later by the friendship of Arthur C. Clarke, Robert
      Heinlein, Frederick Pohl, and most of all by Isaac Asimov.</p>

    <p>
      Of course, the deepest influence on my style of thought came from my
      parents, Henry Minsky and Fannie Reiser. My wife, Gloria Rudisch,
      our children Margaret, Henry, and Juliana (who drew the
      illustrations and sometimes changed the text to make them fit), and
      my sister Ruth all helped to shape this book. My sister Charlotte
      also lives between these lines, for even in our childhood, she was a
      powerful artist and critic, and her dreams became the meanings of my
      ordinary words.</p>
