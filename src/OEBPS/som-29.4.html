<h2>29.4 cross-realm correspondences</h2>

    <p>
      We often describe the things we like
      as <em>elevated,</em> <em>lofty,</em> or
      <em>heavenly.</em> Why do we see such things in terms of altitude in
      space?  We often speak of time itself in spatial terms, as though
      the future were <em>ahead</em> of us while the past remains
      behind. We think of problems as <em>obstacles</em> to go around and
      turn to using diagrams to represent things that don&#39;t have
      shapes at all. What enables us to turn so many skills to so many
      other purposes? These tendencies reflect the
      systematic <em>cross-realm correspondences</em> embodied in our
      families of polynemes and paranomes.</p>

    <p>
      At each instant, several realms may be engaged in active
      processing. Each has separate processes but must compete for control
      of the ascending nemes that lead into the language- agency. Which
      polyneme will play the role of Origin in the next sentence-frame?
      Will it be Mary&#39;s physical arm or hand, or Mary&#39;s social
      role as party guest? It sometimes seems</p>

    <p>
      as though the language-agency can focus on only one realm at a time.</p>

    <p>
      This could be one reason why language scientists find it hard to
      classify the roles words play in sentence-frames. No sooner does a
      language-agency assign some polynemes and isonomes to a phrase than
      various mind divisions proceed to alter how they&#39;re used inside
      each different realm. Every shift of control from one realm to
      another affects which particular nemes will be next to influence the
      language-agency. This causes moment-to-moment changes in the
      apparent meaning of a phrase.</p>

    <p>
      At one moment, control over language may reside in the realm of
      thought that is working most successfully; at the next moment, it
      may be the one experiencing the most difficulty.  Each shift in
      attention affects how the various expressions will be interpreted,
      and this in turn can affect which realm will next take center stage.</p>

    <p>
      For example, the sentence <em>Mary gives Jack the kite</em> might
      start by arousing a listener&#39;s concern with Mary&#39;s social
      role as party guest.  That would cause the pronomes of a
      social-frame to represent Mary&#39;s obligation to bring a
      present. But then the listener&#39;s possession realm might become
      concerned with Mary&#39;s ownership of that gift or with how she got
      control of it. This shift from social to possessional concern could
      then affect the processing of future sentences. For example, it will
      influence whether a phrase like <em>Jack&#39;s kite</em> is
      interpreted to refer to the kite that Jack happens to be holding or
      to a different kite that Jack happens to own.</p>

    <p>
      Every mental realm accumulates its own abilities but also discovers,
      from time to time, how to exploit the skills of other realms. Thus
      the mind as a whole can learn to exploit the frames developed in the
      realm of space both for representing events in time and for thinking
      about social relationships. Perhaps our chaining skills are the best
      example of this; no matter which realm or realms they originate in,
      we eventually learn to apply them to any collection of entities,
      events, or ideas (in any realm whatever) that we can arrange into
      sequences.  Then chains assume their myriad forms, such as spatial
      order, psychological causality, or social dominance.</p>
