<h2>15.11 the recursion principle</h2>

    <p>
      Let&#39;s consider one last time how a mind could juggle nonexistent
      furniture inside an imaginary room. To compare different
      arrangements, we must somehow maintain at least two different
      descriptions in the mind at once. Can we store them in different
      agencies, both active at the same time? That would mean splitting
      our space-arranging-agency into two different smaller portions, each
      working on one of those descriptions. On the surface, there&#39;s
      nothing clearly wrong with that. However, if those smaller agencies
      became involved with similar jobs, then they, in turn, would also
      have to split in two. And then we&#39;d have to do each of those
      jobs with but one-quarter of a mind. If we had to divide agencies
      into smaller and smaller fragments, each job would end up with no
      mind at all!</p>

    <p>
      At first this might seem to be an unusual situation. But it really
      is very common. The best way to solve a hard problem is to break it
      into several simpler ones, and break those into even simpler
      ones. Then we face the same issue of mental fragmentation. Happily,
      there is another way. We can work on the various parts of a problem
      in serial order, one after another, using the same agency over and
      over again.  Of course, that takes more time. But it has one
      absolutely fundamental advantage: each agency can apply its full
      power to every subproblem!</p>

    <p>
      The Recursion Principle: When a problem splits into smaller parts,
      then unless one can apply the mind&#39;s full power to each subjob,
      one&#39;s intellect will get dispersed and leave less cleverness for
      each new task.</p>

    <p>
      Indeed, our minds don&#39;t usually shatter into helpless fragments
      when problems split into parts. We can imagine how to pack a jewelry
      box without forgetting where it will fit into a suitcase. This
      suggests that we can apply our full space-arranging resources to
      each problem in turn. But how, then, do we get back to the first
      problem, after we&#39;ve thought about the other ones, without
      having to start all over again?  To common sense the answer seems
      clear: we simply <em>remember where we were.</em> But this means
      that we must have some way to store,</p>

    <p>
      and later re-create, the states of interrupted agencies. Behind the
      scenes, we need machinery to keep track of all the incomplete
      accomplishments, to remember what was learned along the way, to
      compare different results, and to measure progress in order to
      decide what to do next. All this must go on in accord with larger,
      sometimes changing plans.</p>

    <p>
      The need to recall our recent states is why our <em>short-term
	memories</em> are short-term memories! In order to do their complex
      jobs so quickly and effectively, each micromemory-device must be a
      substantial system of machinery, with many intricate and specialized
      connections. If so, our brains cannot afford to make too many
      duplicate copies of that machinery, so we must reuse what we have
      for different jobs. Each time we reuse a micromemory-device, the
      information stored inside must be erased &mdash; or moved to
      another, less costly place. But that would also take some time and
      interrupt the flow of thought. Our short-term memories must work too
      fast to have any time for consciousness.</p>
