<h2>11.2 the shape of space</h2>

    <p>
      The brain is imprisoned inside the skull, a silent, dark, and
      motionless place; how can it learn what it&#39;s like outside?
      The surface of the brain itself has not the slightest sense of
      touch; it has no skin with which to feel; it is only connected
      to skin. Nor can a brain see, for it has no eyes; it only is
      connected to eyes. The only paths from the world to the brain
      are bundles of nerves like those that come in from the eyes,
      ears, and skin. How do the signals that come through those
      nerves give rise to our sense of <em>being in</em> the outside
      world? The answer is that this sense is a complicated
      illusion. We never actually make any direct contact with the
      outside world. Instead, we work with models of the world that we
      build inside our brains. The next few sections try to sketch how
      that could come about.</p>

    <p>
      The surface of the skin contains countless little touch-sensing
      agents, and the retina of the eye includes a million tiny light
      detectors.  Scientists know a good deal about how these sensors send
      signals to the brain. But we know much less about how those signals
      lead to sensations of touch and of sight. Try this simple
      experiment:</p>

    <p>
      Touch your ear.</p>

    <p>
      What did that feel like? It seems impossible to answer that because
      there&#39;s scarcely anything to say. Now try a different
      experiment:</p>

    <p>
      Touch your ear twice, in two different places, and also touch your
      nose.</p>

    <p>
      Which two touches feel most similar? That question seems much easier
      to answer: one might say that the two ear touches feel more
      similar. Evidently, there is scarcely anything that one can say
      about a
      <em>single sensation</em> by itself, but we can often say much more
      when we can make comparisons.</p>

    <p>
      Consider the analogy to how mathematics treats a <em>perfect
	point.</em> We shouldn&#39;t speak about its shape; it simply
      doesn&#39;t have a shape! But since we&#39;re used to things as
      having shapes,</p>

    <p>
      we can&#39;t help thinking of points as round, like <em>very tiny
	little dots.</em> Similarly, we&#39;re not supposed to talk about
      the size of a point &mdash; since mathematical points, by
      definition, have no size.  Still, we can scarcely help but think,
      in any case, <em>they&#39;re very small.</em>
      
      In fact, there&#39;s absolutely nothing to be said about a single
      point, except how it relates to other points. This is not because
      such things are too complicated to explain, but because they are too
      simple to explain. One cannot even speak about where a point is, by
      itself &mdash; since <em>where</em> has meaning only in relation to
      other points in space. But once we know some pairs of points, we can
      relate these to the lines that connect them, and then we can define
      new, different points where various pairs of lines may
      intersect. Repeating this can generate entire worlds of
      geometry. Once we understand the terrifying fact that points are
      nothing by themselves but exist only in relation to other points,
      then we can ask, as Einstein did, whether time and space are
      anything more than vast societies of nearnesses.</p>

    <p>
      In the same way, there is little that one could say about
      any <em>single touch</em> &mdash; or about what any single
      sense-detecting agent does.  However, there is much more to be
      said about the relations between two or more skin touches, because
      the closer together two skin spots are, the more frequently
      they&#39;ll both be touched at the same time.</p>
