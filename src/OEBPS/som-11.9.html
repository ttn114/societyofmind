<h2>11.9 dumbbell theories</h2>

    <p>
      <!-- (dxh) in the book, it says "this fascination"!--> That
      fascination with those left-right halves, on the part of both
      the lay and scientific populace, is nothing really new. It is a
      symptom of how we acquire various pairs of words that each
      divide some aspect of the world into opposing poles.</p>

    <p>
      Such divisions all have flaws, but often give us useful ways to
      think.  Dividing things in two is a good way to start, but one
      should always try to find at least a third alternative. If one
      cannot, one should suspect that there may not be two ideas at all,
      but only one, together with some form of opposite. A serious problem
      with these two-part forms is that so many of them are so
      similar. This leads us into making false analogies. Consider how the
      pairs below, in which each self is neatly split into two parts, lead
      everyone to think they share some common unity.</p>

      The items on the left are seen as neutrally objective and
      mechanical, and only found within the head. We think of Thought and
      its associates as accurate, but rigid and insensitive. The items on
      the right are seen as matters of the heart &mdash; as vital, warm,
      and individual; we like to believe that Feeling is the better judge
      of the things that ought to matter most. Cool Reason, by itself,
      seems too impersonal, too far from flesh; Emotion lies much closer
      to the heart, but it, too, can be treacherous, through growing so
      intense that reason gets completely overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>
      How marvelous this metaphor! How could it work so well, unless it
      had some basic truth? But wait: whenever any simple idea appears to
      explain so many things, we must suspect a trick. Before we&#39;re
      drawn into dumbbell schemes, we owe it to ourselves to try to
      understand their strange attractiveness, in order that we not be
      deceived, as Wordsworth said, by</p>

    <p>
      . . . some false secondary power, by which, In weakness, we create
      distinctions, then Deem that our puny boundaries are things Which we
      perceive, and not which we have made.</p>
