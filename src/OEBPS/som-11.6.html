<h2>11.6 the centered self</h2>

    <p>
      How do we learn about the real, three-dimensional world?
      We&#39;ve seen how certain agencies might map the layout of the
      skin. But how could we progress from that to learn about the
      world of space beyond the skin? One might ask why infants
      can&#39;t simply <em>look around</em> to see what&#39;s really
      going on. Unfortunately, the easy-sounding phrase
      <em>simply look</em> conceals too many hard problems. When you
      look at an object, some light from it shines into your eye and
      stimulates some sensors there. However, every motion of your
      body, head, or eye makes drastic changes to the image in your
      eye. How can we extract any useful information when everything
      changes so rapidly?  Although it should be possible, in
      principle, to design a machine that could eventually learn to
      relate those motions to the resulting changes in the images,
      this would surely take a long time, and it appears that our
      brains have evolved with special mechanisms that help us
      compensate for motions of the body, head, and eye. This makes it
      easier for other agencies to learn to use visual
      information.</p>

    <p>
      Later we&#39;ll discuss some other realms of thought in which we use
      analogies and metaphors to change our <em>points of view.</em>
      Perhaps those wonderful abilities evolved in similar ways, since
      recognizing that an object is the same when seen from different
      views is not so different from being able to <em>imagine</em> things
      that are not in view at all.</p>

    <p>
      In any case, we really do not understand how the child learns to
      understand space. Perhaps we start by doing many small experiments
      that lead to our first, crude maps of the skin. Next we might start
      to correlate these with the motions of our eyes and limbs; two
      different actions that lead to similar sensations are likely to have
      passed through the same locations in space. A critical step would be
      developing some agents that <em>represent</em> a few <em>places</em>
      outside the skin. Once those places are established (the first ones
      might be near the infant&#39;s face), one could proceed to another
      stage: the assembly of an agency that represents a network of
      relationships, trajectories, and directions between those
      places. Once this is accomplished, the network could continue to
      extend to include new places and relationships.</p>

    <p>
      However, this would be only the beginning. Long ago, psychologists
      like Freud and Piaget observed that children seem to recapitulate
      the history of astronomy: first they imagine the world as centered
      around themselves &mdash; and only later do they start to view
      themselves as moving within a stationary universe, in which the body
      is just like any other object. It takes several years to reach that
      stage, and even in their adolescent years, children are still
      improving their abilities to envision how things appear from other
      viewpoints.</p>
