<h2>17.9 different spans of memories</h2>

    <p>
      Consider the plight of a mother with a new infant. Her baby will
      demand her time for many years. Sometimes she must wonder, <em>How
	does this baby justify such sacrifice?</em> Various answers come to
      mind:
      <em>Because I love it.</em> <em>Because someday it will care for
	me.</em> <em>Because it&#39;s here to carry on our line.</em> But
      reasoning rarely brings answers to such questions. Usually, those
      questions simply fade away as parents continue to nurture their
      children as though they were parts of their own bodies. Sometimes,
      though, strains may overwhelm the mechanisms that protect each
      child from harm, and this results in tragedies.</p>

    <p>
      These complex parent-to-child and child-to-parent bonds must be
      based on certain types of memory. Some memories are less changeable
      than others, and I suspect that attachment-bonds involve
      memory-records of a type that can be rapidly formed but then become
      peculiarly slow to change. On the child&#39;s side, perhaps these
      bonds are descended from the forms of learning
      called <em>imprinting,</em> with which many kinds of infant animals
      quickly learn to recognize their parents. On the parents&#39; side,
      the adult animals of many species will reject infants not involved
      in bonding shortly after birth; then foster-parenting becomes
      impossible. Why should bonding memories be so hard to change? In
      animals, there usually are evolutionary disadvantages to raising the
      offspring of unrelated individuals.  Human infants must develop
      under the additional constraint of requiring constant adult models
      as a basis for their personalities.  Similar goal-affecting bonds
      could explain the often irresistible force of <em>peer pressure</em>
      in later life. Perhaps all such attachment-bonds exploit the same
      machinery.</p>

    <p>
      Many animals form other kinds of social bonds as well, like those in
      which an individual selects a mate and then remains attached to it
      for life. Many people do this, too, and a number of the ones who
      don&#39;t have been observed to select, instead, from among
      alternatives of seemingly similar appearance or character &mdash; as
      though those persons were attached, if not to individuals, to
      certain constant prototypes.  Other people frequently find
      themselves enslaved by infatuations that some parts of their minds
      find unwelcome but cannot prevent or overcome; once formed, those
      memory-bonds will only slowly fade away. The time spans of our
      different sorts of memories evolved to suit, not our own needs, but
      those of our ancestors.</p>

    <p>
      We all know the seemingly inexorable time span of mourning, in which
      it often takes so long to accept the loss of those we love.  Perhaps
      this, too, reflects the slowness of attachment-change, though it is
      only one factor. This could also be partially responsible for the
      prolonged psychological disability that can follow the experience of
      a physical, emotional, or sexual assault upon a person. One might
      ask, since there are so many other devastating aspects of such an
      experience, why it should involve any connection with attachment
      memory. I suspect that any form of intimacy, however unwelcome, has
      effects upon machinery shared by both attachment and sexuality,</p>

    <p>
      and is liable to disturb or disrupt the machinery with which we make
      relationships in ordinary life. No matter how brief that violent
      episode, it may lead to long derangements in our usual
      relationships, in part because those agencies are slow to change. It
      doesn&#39;t help very much for the victim to try to view the
      situation neutrally, because the rest of the mind cannot control
      those agencies; only time can reconstruct their normal
      functioning. It is an injury more terrible than loss of sight or
      limb, to lose the normal use of the agencies with which one builds
      one&#39;s own identity.</p>
