<h1>28 The Mind And The World</h1>
<h2>28.1 the myth of mental energy</h2>

    <p>
      Why do angry people act as though some measure of aggression must be
      spent and, when no proper object lies in reach, strike out and
      damage harmless things? It almost seems as though our feelings can
      accumulate like fluids bottled up inside. In earlier times, some
      scientists identified these quantities with substances like bile and
      blood. No one believes those theories now &mdash; yet still we often
      speak of having mental energy and momentum or of succumbing to
      depletion or inertia. Do <em>mental quantities</em> really exist
      within the mind? If so, how are they made and stored, brought forth
      and then spent? And what are their relations to the quantities and
      magnitudes we read about in technical books? The answer is that
      words like <em>energy</em> and <em>force</em> are not used with much
      precision in everyday psychology. They still have the connotations
      that they carried several centuries ago, when they referred to
      commonsense ideas about vitality. Then, <em>energy</em> referred to
      vigor of action and expression, and <em>force</em> referred to the
      binding strength of a commitment or to the fighting strength of an
      army.</p>

    <p>
      Modern scientists use a concept of energy that, though narrower and
      more precise, not only explains more perfectly why engines stop when
      they run out of fuel, but also applies to our bodies as well: each
      of the cells of which we&#39;re made, including those inside the
      brain, requires some chemical energy in the form of food and
      oxygen. Accordingly, the body as a whole can do only a limited
      amount of physical work before it needs another meal. Now many
      people naively assume that our higher-level mental processes have
      similar requirements and that they need some second form of fuel
      &mdash; a mythical form of mental energy &mdash; to keep from
      becoming bored or mentally exhausted. And yet that simply isn&#39;t
      true! If each of Builder&#39;s agents has physical energy enough to
      do its work, then Builder &mdash; as an agency &mdash; needs nothing
      more to do its work. Builder, after all, is but a name for a certain
      assembly of agents. It can&#39;t require anything its separate
      agents do not need.</p>

    <p>
      Machines and brains require ordinary energy to do their jobs &mdash;
      and need no other, mental forms of energy. Causality is quite enough
      to keep them working toward their goals.</p>

    <p>
      But if our higher-level processes require no extra quantities like
      fuels or energies, what makes it seem to us as though they do? Why
      do so many people talk about their <em>levels of mental or emotional
	energy</em>?  Why do tedious and boring occupations make us
      feel <em>run down</em>? We all experience so many such phenomena
      that we cannot help thinking our minds depend on many kinds
      of <em>mental quantities</em> &mdash; yet scientists apparently have
      shown that no such quantities exist. How can we explain this? It is
      not enough to say, simply, that these phenomena are illusions; we
      must understand why the illusions appear and, if possible, determine
      what functions they serve. The next few sections show how various
      illusions of mental force and energy evolve as convenient ways for
      mental agencies to regulate their transactions, much as many human
      communities have discovered how to use money.</p>
