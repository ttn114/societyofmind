<h2>16.5 avalanche effects</h2>

    <p>
      Few of the schemes we&#39;ve discussed would actually work if they
      were built exactly as they were described. Most of them would soon
      break down because virtually all their agents would become engaged
      into unconstrained activity. Suppose each typical agent tends to
      arouse several others. Then each of those would turn on several more
      &mdash; and each of those would turn on yet others; the activity
      would spread faster than a forest fire. But all that activity would
      accomplish nothing, since all those agents would interfere with each
      other and none of them could gain control of the resources they
      need. Indeed, this is more or less what happens in an attack of
      epilepsy.</p>

    <p>
      Similar problems arise in every biological system. Each simple
      principle or mechanism must be controlled to operate within some
      limited range. Even little groups of genes embody schemes to
      regulate the quantities of proteins they cause to be manufactured
      inside every cell. We find the same pattern repeated on every
      scale. Every biological tissue, organ, and system is regulated by
      several kinds of control mechanisms, and wherever these fail we find
      disease. What normally protects our brains from such avalanches of
      activity? The cross- exclusion scheme is probably the most usual way
      to regulate the levels of activities within our agencies. But there
      are also several other frequently encountered schemes to prevent
      explosions.</p>

    <p>
      Conservation: Force all activities to depend upon some substance or
      other kind of quantity of which only a certain amount is
      available. For example, we controlled our Snarc machine by setting a
      limit on the total electric current available to all the agents;
      this permitted only a few of them to be active at any particular
      moment.
      
      Negative Feedback: Supply a <em>summary</em> device that estimates
      the total activity in the agency and then broadcasts to that agency
      an <em>inhibitory</em> signal whose strength is in proportion to
      that total. This will tend to damp down incipient avalanches.</p>

    <p>
      Censors and Suppressors: The <em>conservation</em> and
      <em>feedback</em> schemes tend to be indiscriminate. Later we&#39;ll
      discuss methods that are more sensitive and versatile in learning to
      recognize &mdash; and then to avoid &mdash; specific patterns of
      activity that have led to trouble in the past.</p>

    <p>
      These methods are simple enough to be applied inside small
      societies, but they are not versatile enough to solve all the
      management difficulties that can arise in the more complex societies
      we need for learning to solve harder problems. Fortunately, systems
      built upon larger scales may be able to apply their own enhanced
      abilities to managing themselves &mdash; by formulating and solving
      their own self-regulation problems. In the next few sections
      we&#39;ll see how such capacities could grow in the course of
      several stages of development.  Not all of this need happen
      independently inside each separate child&#39;s mind, because that
      child&#39;s family and cultural community can develop
      self-regulation schemes of great complexity. All human communities
      seem to work out policies for how their members ought to think, in
      forms that are thought of as common sense or as law, religion, or
      philosophy.</p>
