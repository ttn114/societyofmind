<h1>16 Emotion</h1>
<h2>16.1 emotion</h2>

    <p>
      Why do so many people think emotion is harder to explain than
      intellect? They&#39;re always saying things like this:</p>

    <p>
      <em>I understand, in principle, how a computer might solve problems
	by reasoning. But I can&#39;t imagine how a computer could have
	emotions, or comprehend them. That doesn&#39;t seem at all the
	sort of thing machines could ever do.</em></p>

    <p>
      We often think of anger as nonrational. But in our Challenger
      scenario, the way that Work employs Anger to subdue Sleep seems no
      less rational than using a stick to reach for something beyond
      one&#39;s grasp. Anger is merely an implement that Work can use to
      solve one of its problems. The only complication is that Work cannot
      arouse Anger directly; however, it discovers a way to do this
      indirectly, by turning on the fantasy of Professor Challenger. No
      matter that this leads to states of mind that people call
      emotional. To Work it&#39;s merely one more way to do what it&#39;s
      assigned to do. We&#39;re always using images and fantasies in
      ordinary thought. We use <em>imagination</em> to solve a geometry
      problem, plan a walk to some familiar place, or choose what to eat
      for dinner: in each, we must envision things that aren&#39;t
      actually there. The use of fantasies, emotional or not, is
      indispensable for every complicated problem-solving process. We
      always have to deal with nonexistent scenes, because only when a
      mind can change the ways things appear to be can it really start to
      think of how to change the ways things are.</p>

    <p>
      In any case, our culture wrongly teaches us that thoughts and
      feelings lie in almost separate worlds. In fact, they&#39;re always
      intertwined. In the next few sections we&#39;ll propose to regard
      emotions not as separate from thoughts in general, but as varieties
      or types of thoughts, each based on a different brain-machine that
      specializes in some particular domain of thought. In infancy,
      these <em>protospecialists</em> have little to do with one another,
      but later they grow together as they learn to exploit one another,
      albeit without understanding one another, the way Work exploits
      Anger to stop Sleep.</p>

    <p>
      Another reason we consider emotion to be more mysterious and
      powerful than reason is that we wrongly credit it with many things
      that reason does. We&#39;re all so insensitive to the complexity of
      ordinary thinking that we take the marvels of our common sense for
      granted. Then, whenever anyone does something outstanding, instead
      of trying to understand the process of thought that did the real
      work, we attribute that virtue to whichever superficial emotional
      signs we can easily discern, like motivation, passion, inspiration,
      or sensibility.</p>

    <p>
      In any case, no matter how neutral and rational a goal may seem, it
      will eventually conflict with other goals if it persists for long
      enough.  No long-term project can be carried out without some
      defense against competing interests, and this is likely to produce
      what we call emotional reactions to the conflicts that come about
      among our most insistent goals. The question is not whether
      intelligent machines can have any emotions, but whether machines can
      be intelligent without any emotions. I suspect that once we give
      machines the ability to alter their own abilities we&#39;ll have to
      provide them with all sorts of complex checks and balances. It is
      probably no accident that the term</p>

    <p>
      <em>machinelike</em> has come to have two opposite connotations. One
      means completely unconcerned, unfeeling, and emotionless, devoid of
      any interest. The other means being implacably committed to some
      single cause. Thus each suggests not only inhumanity, but also some
      stupidity. Too much commitment leads to doing only one single thing;
      too little concern produces aimless wandering.</p>
