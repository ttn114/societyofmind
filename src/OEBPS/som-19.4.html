      What does a word like <em>apple</em> mean? This is really many
      questions in one.</p>

    <p>
      How could hearing the word <em>apple</em> make you <em>imagine</em>
      an apple?  How could seeing an apple activate a word-agent
      for <em>apple</em>?  How could thinking about an apple make one
      think of the word for <em>apple</em>?  How could seeing an apple
      make one wordlessly recall the flavor of an apple?</p>

    <p>
      It&#39;s usually impossible to perfectly <em>define</em> a word
      because you cannot capture everything you mean in just a phrase; an
      apple means a thousand things. However, you can usually say some of
      what you mean by making lists of properties. For example, you could
      say that an
      <em>apple</em> is something round and red and good to eat. But what
      exactly is a <em>property</em>? Again, it&#39;s hard to define that
      idea &mdash; but there are several things to say about what
      properties we like our properties to have.</p>

    <p>
      We like the kinds of properties that do not change capriciously.</p>

    <p>
      The color of your car will stay the same from day to day, and,
      barring accidents, so will its basic size and shape, as well as the
      substances of which it is made. Now, suppose you were to paint that
      car a new color: its shape and size would remain the same. This
      suggests another thing we like to find in our properties:</p>

    <p>
      The most useful sets of properties are those whose members do not
      interact too much.</p>

    <p>
      This explains the universal popularity of that particular
      combination of properties: size, color, shape, and
      substance. Because these attributes scarcely interact at all with
      one another, you can put them together in any combination
      whatsoever, to make an object that is either large or small, red or
      green, wooden or glass, and having the shape of a sphere or of a
      cube. And we derive a wonderful power from representing things in
      terms of properties that do not interact: this makes imagination
      practical. It lets us anticipate what will happen when we invent new
      combinations and variations we&#39;ve never seen before. For
      example, suppose that a certain object almost works for a certain
      job &mdash; except for being a bit too small; then you can imagine
      using a <em>larger</em> one. In the same way, you can imagine
      changing the color of a dress or its size, shape, or the fabric of
      which it&#39;s made, without altering any of its other properties.</p>

    <p>
      Why is it so easy to imagine the effects of such changes? First,
      these properties reflect the nature of reality; when we change an
      object&#39;s color or shape, its other properties are usually left
      unchanged.  However, that doesn&#39;t explain why such changes do
      not interact inside the mind. Why is it so easy to imagine a small
      brown wooden cube or a long red silk skirt? The simplest explanation
      is that we represent each of the properties of material, color, size
      and shape in separate agencies. Then those properties can
      simultaneously arouse separate partial states of mind at once, in
      several divisions of the mind. That way, a single word can activate
      many different kinds of thoughts at once! Thus the
      word <em>apple</em> can set your Color agency into
      a <em>redness</em> state, put your Shape agency into
      a <em>roundness</em> state &mdash; or, really, into a representation
      of an indented sphere with a stem &mdash; and cause your Taste and
      Size agencies to react in accord with memories of previous
      experiences with apples. How does language do such things?</p>
