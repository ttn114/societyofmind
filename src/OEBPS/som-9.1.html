<h1>9 Summaries</h1>
<h2>9.1 wanting and liking</h2>

    <p>
      One thing I hate is being asked questions like these:</p>

    <p>
      Do you prefer physics to biology? Did you like that play?  Do you
      like Wagner? Did you enjoy your year abroad?</p>

    <p>
      What makes us want to compress so much into such inexpressive
      summaries as <em>like,</em> <em>prefer,</em> and <em>enjoy</em>? Why
      try to reduce such complex things to simple values or amounts of
      pleasurable quality?  The answer is that our measures of pleasure
      have many uses. They help us make comparisons, compromises, and
      choices. They are involved with the communication signs that we use
      to signify various degrees of attachment, satisfaction, and
      agreement. They show themselves not only in words, but also as
      gestures, intonations, smiles and frowns, and many other expressive
      signs. But we have to be careful not to accept those signs at their
      face value. Neither the state of the world nor that of the mind is
      ever so simple that it can be expressed in a single, one-dimensional
      judgment. No situation is ever completely satisfactory or entirely
      disagreeable, and our reactions of pleasure or disgust are only
      superficial summaries of pyramids of underlying
      processes. To <em>enjoy</em> an experience, some of our agents must
      summarize success &mdash; but other agents must be censuring their
      subordinates for failing to achieve their goals. So we ought to be
      suspicious when we find ourselves liking something very much,
      because that might mean some of our agencies are forcefully
      suppressing other possibilities.</p>

    <p>
      The surer you are that you like what you are doing, the more
      completely your other ambitions are being suppressed.</p>

    <p>
      To choose between alternatives, the highest levels of the mind
      demand the simplest summaries. If your top-level feelings were too
      often
      <em>mixed,</em> you would rarely be able to make a choice to decide
      which foods to eat, which paths to walk, or which thoughts to
      think. At the level of action, you&#39;re forced to simplify right
      down to expressions like <em>Yes</em> and <em>No.</em> But these are
      not informative enough to serve the lower levels of the mind, where
      many processes go on at once, and every agent has to judge how well
      it is serving some local goals. At lower levels of the mind, there
      must be hosts of smaller, coexisting satisfactions and annoyances.</p>

    <p>
      We often talk as though we ought to be controlled by what we want.
      Indeed we scarcely distinguish between wanting something and
      potentially obtaining pleasure from it; the relation between these
      two ideas seems so intimate that it actually feels odd to mention
      it.  It seems so natural to want what we like and to avoid what we
      don&#39;t like that we sometimes feel a sense of unnatural horror
      when another person appears to violate that rule; then we think,
      They surely wouldn&#39;t do such things unless, deep down, they
      really wanted to. It is as though we feel that people ought to want
      only to do the things they like to do.</p>

    <p>
      But the relation between wanting and liking is not simple at all,
      because our preferences are the end products of so many negotiations
      among our agencies. To accomplish any substantial goal, we must
      renounce the other possibilities and engage machinery to keep
      ourselves from succumbing to nostalgia or remorse. Then we use words
      like <em>liking</em> to express the operation of the mechanisms that
      hold us to our choice. Liking&#39;s job is shutting off
      alternatives; we ought to understand its role since, unconstrained,
      it narrows down our universe. This leads to liking&#39;s artificial
      clarity: it does not reflect what liking is but only shows what
      liking does.</p>
