<h2>29.7 likenesses and analogies</h2>

    <p>
      We always try to use old memories to recollect how we solved
      problems in the past. But nothing&#39;s ever twice the same, so
      recollections rarely match. Then we must force our memories to fit
      &mdash; so we can see those different things as similar. To do this,
      we can either modify a memory or change how we represent the present
      scene. For example, suppose you need a hammer but can only find a
      stone. One way to turn that stone to your purposes would be to make
      it fit your memory of a hammer&#39;s appearance &mdash; for example,
      by making your description of the stone include an imaginary
      boundary that divides it into two parts, to serve as handle and as
      head. Another way would be to make your hammer frame accept the
      entire stone as a hammer without a handle. Either scheme will make
      the memory match the description, but both will lead to conflicts in
      other agencies.</p>

    <p>
      How hard it will be to make such a match depends both on which
      agents are now active in your mind and on the levels of their
      priorities &mdash; in short, upon the context already
      established. It will be easy for you to see two things as similar
      when you only need to change relatively weak attachments at the
      conceptual fringes of familiar things. But frequently the ease of
      comprehension will also depend upon how readily you can switch from
      one mental realm to another.</p>

      Consider what must happen in our minds when poets speak about their
      loves in romantic, floral terms. We all have learned a certain
      common way to represent a woman&#39;s beauty in terms of flowers
      that are prone, alas, to fade. For centuries this formula has been
      established in our language and literature; however, at first it
      must have seemed bizarre. We cannot possibly match our descriptions
      of women and flowers if we insist on interpreting such phrases and
      poems <em>literally</em> &mdash; that is to
      say, <em>illiterately</em> &mdash; entirely within the physical
      realm of the appearance, composition, and behavior of a typical
      flower.</p>

    <p>
      To be sure, the colors, symmetries, and smells of flowers can
      certainly arouse the sorts of states we associate with things
      we&#39;ve come to see as beautiful. But the more essential trick is
      in knowing how to turn entirely away from the physical realm and
      dwell instead upon the images and fantasies that flowers evoke in
      other spheres &mdash; such as the sense of a thing so sweet and
      innocent, so helpless and delicate, that it invites affection,
      nurture, and protection. Features like these must be made to fit the
      listener&#39;s private love ideal &mdash; only then can the metaphor
      match.</p>

    <p>
      This, Herrick&#39;s bitter verse defeats. By holding us so tightly
      to the usual frames for human shapes, he steers us into fantasies of
      vegetables with hands and feet.</p>
