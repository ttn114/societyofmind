<h2>17.11 intellectual ideals</h2>

    <p>
      How do we deal with thoughts that lead to frightening results? What
      should one think about the <em>nearly</em> paradox that threatens to
      imply that all things, large and small, might be the same size? One
      strategy would be to constrain that kind of reasoning, by learning
      never to chain together more than two or three such nearness
      links. Then,</p>

    <p>
      perhaps, one might proceed to generalize that strategy, in fear that
      it&#39;s unsafe to chain together too many instances of any form of
      inference.</p>

    <p>
      But what could the phrase <em>too many</em> mean? There is no
      universal answer. Just as in the case of More, we have to learn this
      separately in each important realm of thought: what are the
      limitations of each type and style of reasoning? Human thought is
      not based on any single and uniform kind of <em>logic,</em> but upon
      myriad processes, scripts, stereotypes, critics and censors,
      analogies and metaphors. Some are acquired through the operation of
      our genes, others are learned from our environments, and yet others
      we construct for ourselves. But even inside the mind, no one really
      learns alone, since every step employs many things we&#39;ve learned
      before, from language, family, and friends &mdash; as well as from
      our former Selves. Without each stage to teach the next, no one
      could construct anything as complex as a mind.</p>

    <p>
      There is another way our intellectual growth is not so different
      from our emotional development: we can make intellectual
      attachments, too, and want to think the way certain other persons
      do. These intellectual ideals may stem from parents, teachers, and
      friends; from persons one has never met, such as writers; even from
      legendary heroes who did not exist. I suspect we depend as much on
      images of how we ought to think as we do on images of how we ought
      to feel.  Some of our most persistent memories are about certain
      teachers, but not about what was taught. (At the moment I&#39;m
      writing this, I feel as though my hero Warren McCulloch were
      watching disapprovingly; he would not have liked these neo-Freudian
      ideas.) No matter how emotionally neutral an enterprise may seem,
      there&#39;s no such thing as being <em>purely rational.</em> One
      must always approach each situation with some personal style and
      disposition. Even scientists have to make stylistic choices:</p>

    <p>
      Is there enough evidence yet, or should I seek more? Is it time to
      make a uniframe &mdash; or should I accumulate more examples?  Can I
      rely on older theories here, or should I trust my latest guess?
      Should I try to be Reductionist or Novelist?</p>

    <p>
      At every step, the choices we make depend on what we have become.</p>

    <p>
      Our sciences, arts, and moral skills do not originate from detached
      ideals of truth, beauty, or virtue but stem partly from our
      endeavors to placate or please the images established in earlier
      years. Our adult dispositions thus evolve from impulses so infantile
      that we would surely censure them, if they were not by now
      transformed, disguised, or &mdash; as Freud said
      &mdash; <em>sublimated.</em></p>
