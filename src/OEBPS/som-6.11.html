<h2>6.11 in-sight</h2>

    <p>
      Suppose that while you walked and talked, you could watch the signals
      that traverse your brain. Would they make any sense to you?  Many people
      have done experiments to make such signals audible and visible, by using
      biofeedback devices. This often helps a person to learn to control
      various muscles and glands that are not usually under conscious
      control. But it never leads to comprehending how their hidden circuits
      work.</p>

    <p>
      Scientists encounter similar problems when they use electronic
      instruments to tap into brain signals. This has led to a good deal of
      knowledge about how nervous systems work &mdash; but those insights and
      understandings never came from observation by itself. One cannot use
      data without having at least the beginnings of some theory or
      hypothesis. Even if we could directly sense all the interior details of
      mental life, it wouldn&#39;t tell us how to understand them. It might
      even make that enterprise more difficult, by overwhelming our capacity
      to interpret what we see. The causes and functions of what we observe
      are not themselves things we can observe.</p>

    <p>
      Where do we get the ideas we need? Most of our concepts come from the
      communities in which we&#39;re raised. Even the ideas we
      <em>get</em> for ourselves come from communities &mdash; this time, the
      ones inside our heads. Brains don&#39;t manufacture thoughts in the
      direct ways that muscles exert forces or ovaries make estrogens;
      instead, to get a good idea, one must engage huge organizations of
      submachines that do a vast variety of jobs. Each human cranium contains
      hundreds of kinds of computers, developed over hundreds of millions of
      years of evolution each with a somewhat different architecture. Each
      specialized agency must learn to call on other specialists that can
      serve its purposes. Certain sections of the brain distinguish the sounds
      of voices from other sorts of sounds; other specialized agencies
      distinguish the sights of faces from other types of objects. No one
      knows how many different such organs lie in our brains. But it is almost
      certain that they all employ somewhat different types of programming and
      forms of representation; they share no common language code.</p>

    <p>
      If a mind whose parts use different languages and modes of
      thought attempted to look inside itself, few of those agencies
      would be able to comprehend one another. It is hard enough for
      people who speak different human languages to communicate, and
      the signals used by different portions of the mind are surely
      even less similar. If agent P asked any question of an unrelated
      agent Q, how could Q sense what was asked, or P understand its
      reply? Most pairs of agents can&#39;t communicate at all.</p>
