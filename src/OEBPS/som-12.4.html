<h2>12.4 structure and function</h2>

    <p>
      Suppose an adult watched our child and said, <em>I see you&#39;ve
	built an arch.</em> What might the child think this means? To
      learn new words or new ideas, one must make connections to other
      structures in the mind.
      <em>I see you&#39;ve built an arch</em> should make the child
      connect the word
      <em>arch</em> to agencies embodying descriptions of both the
      Block-Arch and the Hand-Change phenomena &mdash; since those are
      what is on the child&#39;s mind.</p>

    <p>
      But one can&#39;t learn what something means merely by tying things
      to names. Each word-idea must also be invested with some causes,
      actions, purposes, and explanations. Consider all the things a word
      like <em>arch</em> must mean to any real child who understands how
      arches work and how they&#39;re made, and all the ways one can use
      them! A real child will have noticed, too, that arches are like
      variants of many other things experienced before, like <em>bridge
	without a road,</em> <em>wall with door,</em> <em>tablelike,</em>
      or <em>shaped like an upside-down U.</em> We can use such
      similarities to help find other things to serve our purposes: to
      think of an arch as a passage, hole, or tunnel could help someone
      concerned with a transportation problem; describing an arch
      as <em>top held up by sides</em> could help a person get to
      something out of reach.  Which kind of description serves us best?
      That depends upon our purposes.</p>

    <p>
      Among our most powerful ways of thinking are those that let us bring
      together things we&#39;ve learned in different contexts. But how can
      one think in two different ways at once? By building, somewhere
      inside the mind, some arches of a different kind:</p>

    <p>
      Is that a foolish metaphor &mdash; to talk of building bridges
      between places in the mind? I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not an accident
      that we so often frame our thoughts in terms of familiar spatial
      forms. Much of how we think in later life is based on what we learn
      in early life about the world of space.</p>
