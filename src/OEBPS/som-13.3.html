<h2>13.3 seeing and believing</h2>
<img class="illus" src="./illus/ch13/13-6.png"/>

    <p>
      We normally assume that children see the same as we do and only lack
      our tricky muscle skills. But that doesn&#39;t explain why so many
      children produce this particular kind of drawing, nor why they seem
      so satisfied with them. In any case, this phenomenon makes it seem
      very unlikely that a child has a realistic,
      picturelike <em>image</em> in mind.</p>

    <p>
      Now let&#39;s consider a different idea. We&#39;ll suppose that the
      child does not have anything like a picture in mind, but only some
      network of relationships that various <em>features</em> must
      satisfy. For example, a child&#39;s <em>person-drawing</em>
      feature-network might consist of the following features and
      relations:</p>
<img class="illus" src="./illus/ch13/13-7.png" />

    <p>
      To convert this description into an actual drawing, the child must
      employ some sort of <em>drawing procedure.</em> Here&#39;s one in
      which the process simply works its way down the feature list, like a
      little computer program:</p>
<img class="illus" src="./illus/ch13/13-8.png" />

    <p>
      When the child starts to draw, the first item on the list
      is <em>large closed figure.</em> Since there isn&#39;t any such
      thing yet, the child draws one: that&#39;s the head. Next the eyes
      and mouth get drawn. But then, when it comes to drawing the body
      feature, step 2 of the procedure finds that a <em>large closed
	figure</em> has already been drawn. Accordingly, nothing new is
      required, and the procedure simply advances to step 3. As a
      result, the child goes on to attach the arms and legs to the
      feature that has been assigned to both the body and the head.</p>

    <p>
      An adult would never make such a <em>mistake,</em> since once some
      feature has been assigned to represent a head, that feature is
      thereafter regarded as <em>used up</em> or <em>occupied</em> and
      cannot represent anything else. But the child has less capacity or
      inclination for <em>keeping track.</em>  Accordingly, since
      that <em>large closed figure</em> satisfies the description&#39;s
      requirements for both the head and the body &mdash; albeit at
      different moments of time &mdash; there is no cause for
      discontent. The little artist has satisfied all the conditions
      required by its description!</p>
