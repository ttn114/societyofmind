<h1>22 Expression</h1>
<h2>22.1 pronomes and polynemes</h2>

    <p>
      To represent the action <em>Put the apple in the pail,</em> the
      Origin pronome must be assigned to an apple-neme, and the
      Destination pronome to a polyneme for pail. However, at another
      time, another process might need the Origin to represent a block and
      the Destination to represent a tower top. Each pronome must be
      assigned to different things at different times, and only for long
      enough to complete the task of the moment. In other words, a pronome
      is a type of short-term memory.</p>

    <p>
      This suggests a simple way to embody the idea of a pronome: each
      pronome is simply a <em>temporary K-line.</em> The basic difference,
      then, between a pronome and a K-line is that a pronome&#39;s
      connections are temporary rather than permanent. We
      can <em>assign</em> a pronome by temporarily connecting it to
      whichever currently active agents it reaches. Then, when
      we <em>activate</em> that pronome again, those same agents will be
      aroused. To make the Origin pronome represent an apple, first
      activate an apple-neme; this will arouse certain agents.</p>

    <p>
      Next, quickly <em>assign</em> the Origin pronome. Those agents will
      then become attached to that pronome and presumably remain attached
      until the pronome is reassigned.</p>

    <p>
      If we compare pronomes and polynemes from this point of view, we see
      that they are closely related.</p>

    <p>
      Polynemes are permanent K-lines. They are long-term memories.
      Pronomes are temporary K-lines. They are short-term memories.</p>

    <p>
      It is not yet known today how brains form long-term memories. One
      hypothesis would be that we don&#39;t really have temporary K-lines
      at all, but that after a pronome&#39;s K-line is used, it becomes
      permanent, and the pronome machinery gets connected to another,
      previously unused K-line. However this works, we know little about
      it except that it requires a substantial amount of time to form a
      permanent memory &mdash; a time on the order of half an hour. If
      there is any serious disturbance in that interval, no memory will be
      formed. There also is some evidence that we can form new long-term
      memories at rates on the order of no more than perhaps one every few
      seconds, but this is very imprecise because we have no good
      definition of what we mean by separate memories. In any case, this
      seems to suggest that we might have several hundred such processes
      going on at once.</p>

    <p>
      Why does the process take so long? Perhaps because it simply takes
      that long to synthesize chemicals used to make permanent connection
      bridges between agents. Perhaps most of that time is consumed in
      searching for an unused K-line agent, particularly for one that
      already has the required potential connections. Or perhaps the
      required connections could emerge from <em>distributed memories</em>
      like those we mentioned briefly in section 20.9.</p>
