<h2>16.3 mental proto-specialists</h2>

      
      
    <p>
      Suppose you had to build an artificial animal. First you&#39;d make
      a list of everything you want your animal to do. Then you&#39;d ask
      your engineers to find a way to meet each need.</p>

    <p>
      This diagram depicts a separate agency for each of several <em>basic
	needs.</em> Let&#39;s call them <em>proto-specialists.</em> Each
      has a separate mini-mind to do its job and is equipped with
      special sensors and effectors designed to suit its specific
      needs. For example, the proto-specialist for Thirst might have a
      set of parts like these:</p>
    <img class="illus" src="./illus/ch16/16-3.png" />

    <p>
      It would not usually be practical to make an animal that way.  With
      all those separate specialists, we&#39;d end up with a dozen
      different sets of heads and hands and feet. Not only would it cost
      too much to carry and feed all those organs; they&#39;d also get in
      one another&#39;s way!  Despite that inconvenience, there actually
      do exist some animals that work this way and thus can do many things
      at once. Genetically, the swarms of social ants and bees are really
      multibodied individuals whose different organs move around
      freely. But most animals economize by having all their
      proto-specialists share common sets of organs for their interactions
      with the outer world.</p>

    <p>
      Another kind of economy comes from allowing the proto-specialists to
      share what they learn. Whether you seek warmth, safety, nutrition,
      or companionship &mdash; eventually you&#39;ll have to be able to
      recognize and act in order to acquire the objects you need. So even
      though their initial goals are entirely different, all those
      different proto-specialists will end up needing to solve the same
      sorts of <em>subproblems</em> &mdash; such as finding ways around
      obstacles and deciding how to conserve limited resources. Whenever
      we try to solve problems of increasing complexity, whatever
      particular techniques we already know become correspondingly less
      adequate, and it becomes more important to be able to acquire new
      kinds of knowledge and skills. In the end, most of the mechanisms we
      need for any highly ambitious goal can be shared with most of our
      other goals.</p>
