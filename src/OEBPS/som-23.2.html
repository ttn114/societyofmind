<h2>23.2 differences and duplicates</h2>

    <p>
      It is important for us to be able to notice differences. But this
      seemingly innocent requirement poses a problem whose importance has
      never been recognized in psychology. To see the difficulty,
      let&#39;s return to the subject of mental rearrangements. Let&#39;s
      first assume that the problem is to compare two room-arrangement
      descriptions represented in two different agencies: agency A
      represents a room that contains a couch and a chair; agency Z
      represents the same room, but with the couch and chair exchanged.</p>

    <p>
      Now if both agencies are to represent furniture arrangements in ways
      that some third agency D can compare, then the <em>difference-
	detecting</em> agency D must receive two sets of inputs that match
      almost perfectly. Otherwise, every other, irrelevant difference
      between the outputs of A and Z would appear to D to be differences
      in those rooms &mdash; and D would perceive so many spurious
      differences that the real ones would be indiscernible!</p>

    <p>
      The Duplication Problem. The states of two different agencies cannot
      be compared unless those agencies themselves are virtually
      identical.</p>

    <p>
      But this is only the tip of the iceberg, for it is not enough that
      the descriptions to be compared emerge from two almost identical
      agencies. Those agencies must, in turn, receive inputs of near
      identical character. And for that to come about, each of their
      subagencies must also fulfill that same constraint. The only way to
      meet all these conditions is for both agencies &mdash; and all the
      subagencies upon which they depend &mdash; to be identical. Unless
      we find another way, we&#39;ll need an endless host of duplicated
      brains!</p>

    <p>
      This duplication problem comes up all the time. What happens when
      you hear that Mary bought John&#39;s house? Must you have separate
      agencies to keep both Mary and John in your mind at once? Even that
      would not suffice, for unless both person-representing agencies had
      similar connections to all your other agencies, those two
      representations of <em>persons</em> would not have similar
      implications.  The same kind of problem must arise when you compare
      your present situation with some recollection or experience &mdash;
      that is, when you compare how you react to the two different partial
      states of mind. But to compare those two reactions, what kind of
      simultaneous machinery would be needed to maintain both momentary
      personalities? How could a single mind hold room for two &mdash; one
      person old, the other new?</p>
