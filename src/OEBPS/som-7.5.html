<h2>7.5 learning and memory</h2>

    <p>
      There is an old and popular idea that we learn only what we are
      rewarded for. Some psychologists have claimed that human
      learning is based entirely on <em>reinforcement</em> by reward:
      that even when we train ourselves with no external inducements,
      we are still learning from reward &mdash; only now in the form
      of signals from inside ourselves.  But we cannot trust an
      argument that assumes what it purports to prove, and in any
      case, when we try to use this idea to explain how people learn
      to solve hard problems, we encounter a deadly circularity.  You
      first must be able to do something before you can be rewarded
      for doing it!</p>

    <p>
      This circularity was no great problem when Ivan Pavlov studied
      conditioned reflexes nearly a century ago, because in his experiments
      the animals never needed to produce new kinds of behavior; they only had
      to link new stimuli to old behaviors. Decades later, Pavlov&#39;s
      research was extended by the Harvard psychologist B. F. Skinner,</p>

    <p>
      who recognized that higher animals did indeed sometimes exhibit new
      forms of behavior, which he called <em>operants.</em> Skinner&#39;s
      experiments confirmed that when a certain operant is followed by a
      reward, it is likely to reappear more frequently on later occasions.  He
      also discovered that this kind of learning has much larger effects if
      the animal cannot predict when it will be rewarded. Under names
      like <em>operant conditioning</em> and <em>behavior modification,</em>
      Skinner&#39;s discoveries had a wide influence in psychology and
      education, but never led to explaining how brains produce new
      operants. Further- more, few of these animal experiments shed much light
      on how humans learn to form and carry out their complex plans; the
      trouble is that other animals can scarcely learn such things at
      all. Those twin ideas &mdash; reward/success and punish/failure &mdash;
      do not explain enough about how people learn to produce the new ideas
      that enable them to solve difficult problems that could not otherwise be
      solved without many lifetimes of ineffectual trial and error.</p>

    <p>
      The answer must lie in learning better ways to learn. In order to
      discuss these things, we&#39;ll have to start by using many ordinary
      words like goal reward, learning, thinking, recognizing, liking,
      wanting,</p>

    <p>
      imagining, and remembering &mdash; all based on old and vague
      ideas. We&#39;ll find that most such words must be replaced by new
      distinctions and ideas. Still, there&#39;s something common to them all:
      in order to solve any hard problem, we must use various kinds of
      memories. At each moment, we must keep track of what we&#39;ve just done
      &mdash; or else we might repeat the same steps over and over
      again. Also, we must somehow maintain our goals &mdash; or we&#39;ll end
      up doing pointless things.  Finally, once our problem is solved, we need
      access to records of how it was done, for use when similar problems
      arise in the future.</p>

    <p>
      Much of this book will be concerned with memory &mdash; that is, with
      records of the mental past. Why, how, and when should such records be
      made? When the human brain solves a hard problem, many millions of
      agents and processes are involved. Which agents could be wise enough to
      guess what changes should then be made? The high-level agents can&#39;t
      know such things; they scarcely know which lower-level processes
      exist. Nor can lower-level agents know which of their actions helped us
      to reach our high-level goals; they scarcely know that higher-level
      goals exist. The agencies that move our legs aren&#39;t concerned with
      whether we are walking toward home or toward work &mdash; nor do the
      agents involved with such destinations know anything of controlling
      individual muscle units. Where in the mind are judgments made about
      which agents merit praise or blame?</p>
