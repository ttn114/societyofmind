<h2>9.3 learning from failure</h2>

    <p>
      So far, we&#39;ve talked mostly of learning from success. But
      consider that when you succeed, you must already have had the
      necessary means within your grasp. If so, then making changes in
      your mind might only make things worse! As people often say, <em>You
	shouldn&#39;t argue with success.</em> For whenever you try
      to <em>improve</em> an already working procedure, you risk damaging
      whichever other skills depend on that same machinery.</p>

    <p>
      Accordingly, it may be more important that we learn from how we
      fail. What should you do if some well-established method &mdash;
      call it
      <em>M</em> &mdash; has failed to reach a certain goal? One policy
      would be to alter M, so it won&#39;t make the same mistake
      again. But even that might be dangerous because it might cause M to
      fail in other ways. Besides, we might not know how to change M to
      remove the error. A safer way to deal with this would be to modify M
      by adding special memory devices called <em>censors</em>
      and <em>suppressors</em> (we&#39;ll discuss this in detail later),
      which remember particular circumstances in which M fails and later
      proceed to suppress M when similar conditions recur. Such censors
      would not tell you what to do, only what you shouldn&#39;t do;
      still, they prevent your wasting time by repeating old mistakes.</p>

    <p>
      Learning has at least two sides. Some parts of our minds learn from
      success &mdash; by remembering when methods work. But other portions
      of our minds learn mainly when we make mistakes, by remembering the
      circumstances in which various methods failed to work. Later
      we&#39;ll see how this can teach not only what we shouldn&#39;t do,
      but also what we shouldn&#39;t think! When that happens, it can
      permeate our minds with prohibitions and taboos of which we&#39;re
      entirely unaware. Thus, learning from success tends to aim and focus
      how we think, while learning from failure also leads to more
      productive thoughts, but in a less directed way.</p>

    <p>
      We would not need to deal with exceptions and censors if we lived in
      a universe of simple, general rules with no exceptions, as in the
      lovely mathematical worlds of arithmetic, geometry, and logic. But
      perfect logic rarely works in the real worlds of people, thoughts,
      and things.</p>

    <p>
      This is because it is no accident that there are no exceptions to
      the rules in those mathematical worlds: there, we start with the
      rules and imagine only objects that obey them. But we can&#39;t so
      willfully make up the rules for objects that already exist, so our
      only course is to begin with imperfect guesses &mdash; collections
      of rough and ready rules &mdash; and then proceed to find out where
      they&#39;re wrong.</p>

    <p>
      Naturally, we tend to prefer learning from success rather than from
      failure. However, I suspect that confining ourselves
      to <em>positive</em> learning experiences alone leads to relatively
      small improvements in what we can already do. Probably, there is no
      way to avoid at least a certain degree of discomfort when we make
      substantial changes in how we think.</p>
