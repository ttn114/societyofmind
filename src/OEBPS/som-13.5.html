<h2>13.5 learning a script</h2>
<img class="illus" src="./illus/ch13/13-11.png"/>

    <p>
      What will our portrait-drawing child try next? Some children keep
      working to improve their person pictures. But most of them go on to
      put their newfound skills to work at drawing more ambitious scenes
      in which two or more picture-people interact. This involves
      wonderful problems about how to depict social interactions and
      relationships &mdash; and these more ambitious projects lead the
      child away from being concerned with making the pictures of the
      individual more elaborate and realistic. When this happens, the
      parent may feel disappointed at what seems to be a lack of
      progress. But we should try to appreciate the changing character of
      our children&#39;s ambitions and recognize that their new problems
      may be even more challenging.</p>

    <p>
      This doesn&#39;t mean that drawing learning stops. Even as those
      children cease to make their person pictures more elaborate, the
      speed at which they draw them keeps increasing, and with seemingly
      less effort. How and why does this happen? In everyday life, we take
      it for granted that <em>practice makes perfect,</em> and that
      repeating and rehearsing a skill will, somehow, automatically cause
      it to become faster and more dependable. But when you come to think
      of it, this really is quite curious. You might expect, instead, that
      the more you learned, the slower you would get &mdash; from having
      more knowledge from which to choose! How does practice speed things
      up?</p>

    <p>
      Perhaps, when we practice skills we can already perform, we engage a
      special kind of learning, in the course of which the original
      performance process is replaced or <em>bridged-across</em> by new
      and simpler processes. The <em>program</em> to the left below shows
      the many steps our novice portrait drawer had to take in order to
      draw each childish body-face. The <em>script</em> to the right shows
      only those steps that actually produce the lines of the drawing;
      this script has only half as many steps.</p>

    <p>
      The people we call <em>experts</em> seem to exercise their special
      skills with scarcely any thought at all &mdash; as though they were
      simply reading preassembled scripts. Perhaps when
      we <em>practice</em> to improve our skills, we&#39;re mainly
      building simpler scripts that don&#39;t engage so many
      agencies. This lets us do old things with much less <em>thought</em>
      and gives us more time to think of other things. The less the child
      has to think of where to put each arm and leg, the more time remains
      to represent what that picture-person is actually doing.</p>
