<h2>12.8 problems of disunity</h2>

    <p>
      When should you accumulate, and when should you make uniframes?  The
      choice depends upon your purposes. Sometimes it is useful to regard
      things as similar because they have similar forms, but sometimes it
      makes more sense to group together things with similar uses. At one
      moment you may wish to emphasize a similarity; at the next moment,
      you may want to emphasize a distinction. Often, we have to use both
      uniframes and accumulations in combination. In Block-Arch, for
      example, we found that there could be two different kinds of arch
      tops &mdash; the block and the wedge. Accordingly, when we used the
      phrase <em>block or wedge,</em> we actually inserted a
      <em>subaccumulation</em> into our uniframe.</p>

    <p>
      Accumulations rarely seem quite satisfactory because we feel ideas
      should have more unity. We wouldn&#39;t have a word for chair or
      arch or currency if they meant nothing more than lists of unrelated
      things.  If each did not involve some unifying thought, we&#39;d
      never think to make those lists in the first place! Why is it so
      hard to describe their essences? In the next few sections we&#39;ll
      discover a number of reasons for this. Here is one of them:</p>

    <p>
      Many good ideas are really two ideas in one &mdash; which form a
      bridge between two realms of thought or different points of view.</p>

    <p>
      Whenever we build a bridge between structure and function, one end
      of that bridge may represent a goal or use, while the other end
      describes what we might use to gain those ends. But it is rare for
      those structures to correspond neatly to those functions. The
      problem is that we usually find many different ways to achieve any
      goal. This means that we&#39;ll find an accumulation on the
      structural side of the bridge. For example, if you want to reach
      something high up, you can stand on a chair, reach with a stick, or
      ask someone taller to get it for you. Similarly, an accumulation of
      functions or goals can be found for any structure. My colleague
      Oliver Selfridge once wrote an entire book entitled Things to Do
      with a Stick.</p>

    <p>
      Our different worlds of ends and means don&#39;t usually match up
      very well. So when we find a useful, compact uniframe in one such
      world, it often corresponds to an accumulation in our other worlds.</p>

    <p>
      We encountered this problem earlier. When we classified birds as
      animals while classifying airplanes as machines, we thereby forced
      disunity upon the class of things that fly. Later, when we come to
      theories about metaphors, we&#39;ll see that such problems are
      almost inevitable because we know only a very few &mdash; and,
      therefore, very precious &mdash; schemes whose unifying powers cross
      many realms.</p>
