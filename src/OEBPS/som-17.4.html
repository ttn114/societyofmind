<h2>17.4 functional autonomy</h2>

    <p>
      We&#39;ve talked about some ways to learn goals from other
      people. But how do we come to make goals for ourselves? It seems
      simple enough always to move from goal to subgoal &mdash; but how
      could one go the other way, moving outward to find new kinds of
      goals? Our answer may seem strange at first: there is a sense in
      which we never really need to invent new <em>high-level</em> goals
      at all. This is because, in principle, at least, it is enough to
      keep inventing lower-level subgoals for problems that we have to
      solve! Here is why this need not limit our ambitions:</p>

    <p>
      Functional Autonomy. In the course of pursuing any sufficiently
      complicated problem, the subgoals that engage our attentions can
      become both increasingly more ambitious and increasingly detached
      from the original problem.</p>

    <p>
      Suppose a baby&#39;s initial goal was to reach a certain cup. This
      could lead to the subgoal of learning how to move the arm and hand
      efficiently, which, in turn, could lead to sub-subgoals of learning
      to move around obstacles. And this could keep growing into
      increasingly general and abstract goals of learning how to
      understand and manage the physical world of space and time. Thus one
      can begin with a lowly goal, yet end up with some sub-subgoals that
      lead our minds into the most ambitious enterprises we can conceive.</p>

    <p>
      This can also happen in the social realm. The same baby can form,
      instead, the subgoal of engaging another person&#39;s help in
      bringing it that drinking cup. This can lead to trying to find more
      effective ways to influence that other person &mdash; and thus the
      child could become concerned with representing and predicting the
      motives and dispositions of other people. Again, a relatively modest
      drinking goal can lead to a larger competence &mdash; this time in
      the realm of comprehending social interactions. An initially simple
      concern with personal comfort becomes transformed into a more
      ambitious, less self-centered enterprise.</p>

    <p>
      Virtually any problem will be easier to solve the more one learns
      about the context world in which that problem occurs.  No matter
      what one&#39;s problem is, provided that it&#39;s hard enough, one
      always gains from learning better ways to learn.</p>

    <p>
      Many of us like to believe that our intellectual enterprises lie on
      higher planes than our everyday activities. But now we can turn that
      academic value-scheme upon its head. When we get right down to it,
      our most abstract investigations can be seen as having origins in
      finding means to ordinary ends. These turn into what we regard as
      noble qualities when they gain enough functional autonomy to put
      their roots aside. In the end, our initial goals matter scarcely at
      all, because no matter what our original objectives, we can gain
      more by becoming better able to predict and control our world. It
      may not even matter whether an infant was initially inclined to
      emulate or to oppose a parent, or was first moved primarily by fear
      or by affection.  The implements of accomplishment are much the same
      in either case.  Knowledge is power. Whatever one&#39;s goals, they
      will be easier to achieve if one can become wise, wealthy, and
      powerful. And these in turn can best be gained by understanding how
      things work.</p>
