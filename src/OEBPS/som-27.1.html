<h1>27 Censors And Jokes</h1>
<h2>27.1 demons</h2>

    <p>
      Our reader must be anxious to know what finally became of Mary and
      that kite. Here is more of that story.</p>

    <p>
      Mary was invited to Jack&#39;s party. She wondered if he would like
      a kite. Jane said, <em>Jack already has a kite. He will make you
	take it back.</em></p>

    <p>
      What does the pronoun <em>it</em> mean here? Clearly Jane is
      speaking not of the kite that already belongs to Jack, but of the
      new kite that Mary is thinking of giving to him. But what leads the
      listener to assume that this is what the storyteller meant? There
      are many issues here besides the question of which kite is
      involved. How do we know <em>it</em> refers to a kite at all?
      Does <em>take it back</em> mean take it back from Jack or to return
      it to the store? For the sake of simplicity, let&#39;s put aside the
      other possibilities and assume that <em>it</em> must mean a
      kite. But in order to decide which kite is meant, we still must
      understand the larger phrase <em>take it back.</em> This phrase must
      refer to some structure already in the listener&#39;s mind; the
      narrator expects the listener to find the appropriate structure by
      activating an appropriate fragment of commonsense knowledge about
      giving and receiving birthday presents. But since every listener
      knows so many things, what sorts of processes could activate the
      appropriate knowledge without taking too much time? In 1974 Eugene
      Charniak, a graduate student at MIT, asked how each phrase of this
      story works to prepare the reader to comprehend the subsequent
      phrases. He suggested that whenever we hear about a particular
      event, specific recognition-agents are thereby aroused. These then
      proceed actively to watch and wait for other related types of
      events. (Because these recognition-agents lurk silently, to
      intervene only in certain circumstances, they are sometimes
      called <em>demons.</em>) For example, whenever a story contains the
      slightest hint that someone may have purchased a gift, specific
      demons might be aroused that watch for events like these:</p>

    <p>
      If there is evidence that the recipient rejects the gift, look for
      signs of it being returned. If you see evidence of a gift being
      returned, look for signs that the recipient rejected it.</p>

    <p>
      Charniak&#39;s thesis raised many questions. How easy should it be
      to activate demons? How long should they then remain active? If too
      few demons are aroused, we&#39;ll be slow to understand what&#39;s
      happening. But if too many become active, we&#39;ll get confused by
      false alarms. There are no simple solutions to these problems, and
      what we call <em>understanding</em> is a huge accumulation of
      skills. You might understand certain parts of a story by using
      separate, isolated demons; you might comprehend other aspects of
      that same story by using larger-scale processes that try to match
      the sequence of events to various remembered scripts; yet other
      understandings might depend upon which agents are aroused by various
      micronemes.  How much of the fascination in telling a story, or in
      listening to one, comes from the manipulations of our demons&#39;
      expectations?</p>
