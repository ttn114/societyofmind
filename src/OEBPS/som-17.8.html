    <blockquote>Guilt is the gift that keeps on giving.

    <p>
      All people talk of goals and dreams, of personal priorities, of
      goods and bads, rights and wrongs, virtues and depravities. What
      makes our ethics and ideals develop in our children&#39;s minds?</p>

    <p>
      In one of the theories of Sigmund Freud, an infant becomes enamored
      of one or both parents, and somehow this leads the baby into
      absorbing or, as Freud put it, <em>introjecting</em> the goals and
      values of those love-objects. Thenceforth, throughout later life,
      those parent-images persist inside the grown-up child&#39;s mind, to
      influence whatever thoughts and goals are considered worthy of
      pursuit. We are not compelled to agree with all of Freud&#39;s
      account, but we have to explain why children develop models of their
      parents&#39; values at all.</p>

    <p>
      So far as the child&#39;s safety is concerned, it would suffice for
      attachment to keep the child in the parents&#39; physical
      vicinity. What could be the biological and psychological functions
      of developing complicated self-ideals?</p>

    <p>
      The answer seems quite clear to me. Consider that our models of
      ourselves are so complex that even adults can&#39;t explain
      them. How could a fragmentary infant mind know enough to build such
      a complicated thing &mdash; without some model upon which to base
      it? We aren&#39;t horn with built-in Selves &mdash; but most of us
      are fortunate enough to he born with human caretakers. Then, our
      attachment mechanisms force us to focus on our parents&#39; ways,
      and this leads us to build crude images of what those parents
      themselves are like. That way, the values and goals of a culture
      pass from one generation to the next.  They are not learned the way
      skills are learned. We learn our earliest values under the influence
      of attachment-related signals that represent, not our own success or
      failure, but our parents&#39; love or rejection. When we maintain
      our standards, we feel virtuous rather than merely successful. When
      we violate those standards, we feel shame and guilt rather than mere
      disappointment. This is not just a matter of words: those things are
      not the same; it is like the difference between ends and means.</p>

    <p>
      How could coherence be imposed upon a multitude of mindless
      agencies? Freud may have been the first to see that this could
      emerge from the effects of infant attachment. It was several more
      decades before psychologists recognized that separating children
      from their attachments can have devastating effects on the growth of
      their personalities. Freud also observed that children frequently
      reject one parent in favor of the other, in a process that suggests
      the cross-exclusiveness of sexual jealousy; he called this the
      Oedipus complex. It seems plausible that something of this sort
      ought to happen regardless of any connection between attachment and
      sexuality. If a developing identity is based upon that of another
      person, it must become confusing to be attached to two dissimilar
      adult <em>models.</em> This might lead a child to try to simplify
      the situation by rejecting or removing one of them from the scene.</p>

    <p>
      Many people dislike the thought of being dominated from within by
      the image of a parent&#39;s wish. Yet, in exchange, that slavery is
      just what makes us relatively free (as compared with other animals)
      from being forced to obey so many other kinds of unlearned, built-in
      instinct-goals.</p>
