<h2>22.11 creative expression</h2>

    <p>
      There is a wonderful capacity that comes along with the ability to
      <em>express</em> ideas. Whatever we may want to say, we probably
      won&#39;t say exactly that. But in exchange, there is a chance of
      saying something else that is both good and new! After all,
      the <em>thing we want to say</em> &mdash; the structure p we&#39;re
      trying to describe &mdash; is not always a definite, fixed structure
      that our language-agents can easily read and copy. If p exists at
      all, it&#39;s likely to be a rapidly changing network involving
      several agencies. If so, then the language-agency may only be able
      to make guesses and hypotheses about p and try to confirm or refute
      them by performing experiments. Even if p were well defined in the
      first place, this very process is liable to change it, so that the
      final version q won&#39;t be the same as the original structure p.
      Sometimes we call this process <em>thinking in words.</em></p>

    <p>
      In other words, whether or not what you <em>meant</em> to say
      actually existed before you spoke, your language-agencies are likely
      either to reformulate what did exist or create something new and
      different from anything you had before. Whenever you try to express
      with words any complicated mental state, you&#39;re forced to
      oversimplify &mdash; and that can cause both loss and gain. On the
      losing side, no word description of a mental state can ever be
      complete; some nuances are always lost. But in exchange, when
      you&#39;re forced to separate the essences from accidents, you gain
      the opportunity to make reformulations. For example, when stuck on a
      problem, you may <em>say to yourself</em> things like <em>Now,
	let&#39;s see &mdash; just what was I really trying to
	accomplish?</em> Then, since your language-agency knows so little
      about the actual state of those other agencies it must answer such
      questions by making theories about them, and these may well leave
      you in a state that is simpler, clearer, and better suited to
      solving your problem.</p>

    <p>
      When we try to explain what we think we know, we&#39;re likely to
      end up with something new. All teachers know how often we understand
      something for the first time only after trying to explain it to
      someone else. Our abilities to make language descriptions can engage
      all our other abilities to think and to solve problems. If speaking
      involves thinking, then one must ask, <em>How much of ordinary
	thought involves the use of words?</em> Surely many of our most
      effective thinking methods scarcely engage our language-agencies at
      all. Perhaps we turn to words only when other methods fail. But then
      the use of language can open entirely new worlds of thought. This is
      because once we can represent things in terms of strings of words,
      it becomes possible to use them in a boundless variety of ways to
      change and rearrange what happens in our other agencies. Of course,
      we never realize we&#39;re doing this; instead we refer to such
      activities by names like paraphrase or change of emphasis, as though
      we weren&#39;t changing what we&#39;re trying to describe. The
      crucial thing is that during the moments in which those word-strings
      are detached from their
      <em>meanings,</em> they are no longer subject to the constraints and
      limitations of other agencies, and the language-systems can do what
      they want with them. Then we can transmit, from one person&#39;s
      brain to another, the strings of words our grammar-tactics produce,
      and every individual can gain access to the most successful
      formulations that others can articulate. This is what we call
      culture &mdash; the conceptual treasures our communities accumulate
      through history.</p>
