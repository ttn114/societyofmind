<h2>6.2 signals and signs</h2>

    <p>
      How do we ever understand anything? Almost always, I think, by using one
      or another kind of analogy &mdash; that is, by representing each new
      thing as though it resembles something we already know. Whenever a new
      thing&#39;s internal workings are too strange or complicated to deal
      with directly, we represent whatever parts of it we can in terms of more
      familiar signs. This way, we make each novelty seem similar to some more
      ordinary thing. It really is a great discovery, the use of signals,
      symbols, words, and names. They let our minds transform the strange into
      the commonplace.</p>

    <p>
      Suppose an alien architect has invented a radically new way to go from
      one room to another. This invention serves the normal functions of a
      door, but it has a form and mechanism so far outside our experience that
      to see it, we would never recognize it as a door, nor guess how to use
      it. All its physical details are wrong. It is not what we normally
      expect a door to be &mdash; a hinged, swinging, wooden slab set into a
      wall. No matter: just superimpose on its exterior some decoration,
      symbol, icon, token, word, or sign that can remind us of its use. Clothe
      it in a rectangular shape, or add to it a push-plate lettered EXIT in
      red and white, and every visitor from the planet Earth will know,
      without a conscious thought, just what that pseudoportal&#39;s purpose
      is, and use it as though it were a door.</p>

    <p>
      At first it may seem mere trickery, to assign the symbol for a door to
      an invention that is not really a door. But we&#39;re always in that
      same predicament. There are no doors inside our minds, only connections
      among our signs. To overstate the case a bit, what we call
      <em>consciousness</em> consists of little more than menu lists that
      flash, from time to time, on mental screen displays that other systems
      use. It is very much like the way the players of computer games use
      symbols to invoke the processes inside their complicated game machines
      without the slightest understanding of how they work.</p>

    <p>
      And when you come to think about it, it scarcely could be otherwise!
      Consider what would happen if we actually could confront the
      trillion-wire networks in our brains. Scientists have peered at tiny
      fragments of those structures for many years, yet failed to comprehend
      what they do. Fortunately, for the purposes of everyday life, it is
      enough for our words or signals to evoke some useful happenings within
      the mind. Who cares how they work, so long as they work! Consider how
      you can scarcely see a hammer except as something to hit with, or see a
      ball except as something to throw and catch. Why do we see things, less
      as they are, and more in view of how they can be used? It is because our
      minds did not evolve to serve as instruments for science or philosophy,
      but to solve practical problems of nutrition, defense, procreation, and
      the like. We tend to think of knowledge as good in itself, but knowledge
      is useful only when we can exploit it to help us reach our goals.</p>
