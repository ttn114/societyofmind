<h2>10.4 papert's principle</h2>
    
    
    <p>
      What should one do when different kinds of knowledge don&#39;t
      agree?  It sometimes helps to place them in some order of priority,
      but as we&#39;ve seen, that can still lead to mistakes. How can we
      make our system sensitive to different circumstances? The secret is
      to use the principle of noncompromise and look for help from other
      agencies!  For help with comparing quantities, we&#39;ll need to add
      new
      <em>administrative agents</em> to our Society-of-More.</p>

    <p>
      The new Appearance administrator is designed to say <em>more</em>
      when the agent Tall is active, to say <em>less</em> when the agent
      Thin is active,</p>

    <p>
      and to say nothing at all when something appears both taller and
      thinner. Then the other new administrator, History, makes the
      decision on the basis of what Confined says.</p>

    <p>
      This explanation of the difference between the older and younger
      children was first proposed by Seymour Papert in the 1960s, when we
      first started to explore society of mind ideas. Most previous
      theories had tried to explain Piaget&#39;s experiments by suggesting
      that children develop different kinds of reasoning as time goes
      by. That certainly is true, but the importance of Papert&#39;s
      conception is in emphasizing not merely the ingredients of
      reasoning, but how they&#39;re organized: a mind cannot really grow
      very much merely by accumulating knowledge. It must also develop
      better ways to use what it already knows. That principle deserves a
      name.</p>

    <p>
      Papert&#39;s Principle: Some of the most crucial steps in mental
      growth are based not simply on acquiring new skills, but on
      acquiring new administrative ways to use what one already knows.</p>

    <p>
      Our two new middle-level managers illustrate this idea: Appearance
      and History form a new, intermediate layer that groups together
      certain sets of lower-level skills. The choice of agents for those
      groups is absolutely critical. The system will work quite well if we
      group Tall and Thin together, so that Confined can take control when
      they conflict. But it would only make things worse if we were to
      group Tall and Confined together! Then what decides which groups to
      form?  Papert&#39;s principle suggests that the processes which
      assemble agents into groups must somehow exploit relationships among
      the skills of those agents. For example, because Tall and Thin are
      more similar in character to one another than to Confined, it makes
      sense to group them more closely together in the administrative
      hierarchy.</p>
