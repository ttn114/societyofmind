<h2>26.11 grammar</h2>

    <p>
      How do we choose the words we speak, and how do we understand what
      others say? Earlier, I suggested that in the course of learning
      language we accumulate various processes and tactics that enable us
      to partially reproduce our own mental operations in other speakers.
      These processes affect our choices of words, the forms we select for
      phrases and sentences, and the styles in which we frame our
      narratives. There have been many attempts to study how children
      learn language, but psychologists do not yet have coherent theories
      about the underlying processes. For example, we do not yet even know
      whether we learn each bit of grammar only once &mdash; or whether we
      have to learn it twice, for speaking and for understanding what
      other people say.</p>

    <p>
      We know so little about such matters that we can scarcely even
      speculate about the nature of those early language-learning steps.
      Perhaps the process starts with some agents that can enable a child
      to make various vocal sounds in response to specific internal
      states.  These agents then become involved with
      built-in <em>predestined</em> learning processes that lead to
      limited abilities to imitate other sounds the child hears by using
      feedback from its ears. Later stages might then engage new layers of
      agents that connect word-sound agents to whichever polynemes are
      most frequently attached to certain pronomes in the
      language-agency. Once a suitable variety of such processes are
      established, more layers of frame- and memory- controlling agents
      could learn to support more complex language skills.</p>

    <p>
      Let&#39;s try to imagine what kind of process could produce a
      language phrase that <em>expresses</em> a description of an
      object. Suppose, for example, that you want to draw attention to a
      certain very big box.  To imagine such a thing in the first place,
      you might first have to activate your polyneme for <em>box</em> and
      then arouse some other isonomes and polynemes that modify the state
      of your Size agency. To express <em>very big box</em> might thus
      require grammar-tactics that express three mental operations:</p>

    <p>
      --- <em>box</em> expresses the arousal of the box polyneme;
      
      --- <em>big</em> expresses a process that selects the Size agency;</p>

    <p>
      --- <em>very</em> expresses an isonome that adjusts the
      sensitivities of agents in whichever agency was selected.</p>

    <p>
      I do not mean to suggest that a child&#39;s earliest three-word noun
      phrases must be based upon such complicated processes; more likely
      they begin with simpler sequence scripts. Eventually, though, more
      complex systems intervene to replace the simple scripts by intricate
      kinds of frame-arrays that enable the child to make more complex
      rearrangements of what becomes attached to its expression-frames.
      Then, as the language-agency acquires more isonome-controlling
      skills, the child can learn to use pronouns like <em>it</em>
      or <em>she</em> to express other structures that are already
      attached to suitable pronomes. Also, as we develop skills for
      building chains and trees from other frames, the language-agency can
      learn to use corresponding grammar-tactics to express those chains
      &mdash; stringing together phrases and sentences with conjunction
      words like <em>and</em></p>

    <p>
      and <em>but.</em> Similarly, as we improve our methods for
      controlling memories and managing interruptions, we can learn to
      combine those skills with clause-interrupting forms
      like <em>who</em> and <em>which.</em>  There seems scarcely any
      limit to the complexity of our social inventions for expressing
      mental processes, and it takes most children many years to master
      all the language arts their ancestors evolved.</p>
