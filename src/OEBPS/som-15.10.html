<h2>15.10 losing track</h2>

    <p>
      Whenever we solve complicated problems, we get into situations in
      which our agencies must keep account of many processes at once. In
      computer programs, the many <em>subjobs</em> often seem to pile up
      like the blocks of a tower. Indeed, computer programmers often use
      the word
      <em>stack</em> to describe such situations. But I doubt that
      untrained human minds use anything so methodical; in fact, we simply
      aren&#39;t very good at dealing with the kinds of situations that
      need such memory-stacks.  This could be why we get confused when
      hearing sentences like this:</p>

    <p>
      This is the malt that the rat that the cat that the dog worried
      killed ate.</p>

    <p>
      The very same words can be rearranged to make an equivalent sentence
      anyone can understand:</p>

    <p>
      This is the dog that worried the cat that killed the rat that ate
      the malt.</p>

    <p>
      The first sentence is hard to understand because so many verb
      processes interrupt one another that when the end of the sentence
      comes, three similar processes are still active &mdash; but they
      have lost track of what roles should be assigned to all the
      remaining nouns, namely, the rat, cat, and malt. Why do visual
      processes so rarely encounter similar difficulties?  One reason is
      that our visual-systems can support more simultaneously operating
      processes than our language-systems can, and this reduces the need
      for any process to interrupt another one. A second reason is that
      the vision-agencies can choose for themselves the sequence in which
      they attend to details, whereas language-agencies are controlled by
      the person who is speaking.</p>

    <p>
      It takes each person many years to learn to use those memory-
      systems well. Younger children certainly cannot keep track as well
      as adults. It&#39;s generally of little use to ask a pair of
      two-year-olds to play together or to take turns at using a toy. We
      consider them to be too self-centered and impatient for that. Surely
      much of their undisciplined impulsiveness comes from desires that
      are less regulated than our own. But that impatience could also stem
      from insecurity about memory: the child may fear that what it wants
      will slip from mind while other thoughts are entertained. In other
      words, the child who is asked to <em>take turns</em> might fear that
      by the time its turn arrives, it may not want the object anymore.</p>

    <p>
      When people ask, <em>Could a machine ever be conscious?</em> I&#39;m
      often tempted to ask back, <em>Could a person ever be
	conscious?</em> I mean this as a serious reply, because we seem so
      ill-equipped to understand ourselves. Long before we became
      concerned with understanding how we work, our evolution had already
      constrained the architecture of our brains. However, we can design
      our new machines as we wish, and provide them with better ways to
      keep and examine records of their own activities &mdash; and this
      means that machines are potentially capable of far more
      consciousness than we are. To be sure, simply providing machines
      with such information would not automatically enable them to use it
      to promote their own development, and until we can design more
      sensible machines, such knowledge might only help them find more
      ways to fail: the easier to change themselves, the easier to wreck
      themselves &mdash; until they learn to train
      themselves. Fortunately, we can leave this problem to the designers
      of the future, who surely would not build such things unless they
      found good reasons to.</p>
