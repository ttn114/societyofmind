<h2>22.6 expression</h2>

    <p>
      Language lets us treat our thoughts as though they were much like
      ordinary things. Suppose you meet someone who is trying to solve a
      problem. You ask what&#39;s happening. <em>I&#39;m thinking,</em>
      you are told. <em>I can see that,</em> you say, <em>but what are you
	thinking about?</em> <em>Well, I was looking for a way to solve this
	problem, and I think I&#39;ve just found one.</em>  We speak as
      though ideas resemble building-blocks that one can find and grasp!</p>

    <p>
      Why do we <em>thing-ify</em> our thoughts? One reason is that this
      enables us to reapply the wonderful machines our brains contain for
      understanding worldly things. Another thing it does is help us
      organize our expeditions in the mental world, much as we find our
      ways through space. Consider how the strategies we use
      to <em>find</em> ideas resemble the strategies we use for finding
      real things: Look in the places they used to be or where they&#39;re
      usually found &mdash; but don&#39;t keep looking again and again in
      the same place. Indeed, for many centuries our memory-training arts
      have been dominated by two techniques.  One is based on similarities
      of sounds, exploiting the capacities of our language-agencies to
      make connections between words. The other method is based on
      imagining the items we want to remember as placed in some familiar
      space, such as a road or room one knows particularly well. This way,
      we can apply our thing-location skills to keeping track of our
      ideas.</p>

    <p>
      Our ability to treat ideas as though they were objects goes together
      with our abilities to reuse our brain-machinery over and over again.
      Whenever an agency becomes overburdened by a large and complicated
      structure, we may be able to treat that structure as a simple,
      single unit by thing-ifying &mdash; or, as we usually say,
      <em>conceptualizing</em> &mdash; it. Then, once we replace a larger
      structure by representing it with a compact symbol-sign, that
      overloaded agency may be able to continue its work. This way, we can
      build grand structures of ideas &mdash; much as we can build great
      towers from smaller parts.</p>

    <p>
      I suspect that, as they&#39;re represented in the mind, there&#39;s
      little difference between a physical object and an idea. Worldly
      things are useful to us because they are <em>substantial</em>
      &mdash; that is, because their properties are relatively
      permanent. Now we don&#39;t usually think of ideas as substantial,
      because they don&#39;t have the usual properties of worldly things
      &mdash; such as color, shape, and weight. Yet <em>good ideas</em>
      must also have substantiality, albeit of a different sort:</p>

    <p>
      No conception or idea could have much use unless it could remain
      unchanged &mdash; and stay in some kind of mental
      <em>place</em> &mdash; for long enough for us to find it when we
      need it. Nor could we ever achieve a goal unless it could persist
      for long enough. In short, no mind can work without some stable
      states or memories.</p>

    <p>
      This may sound as though I&#39;m speaking metaphorically, since a
      mental <em>place</em> is not exactly like a worldly place. But then,
      when you think of a place you know, that thought itself is not a
      worldly place, but only a linkage of memories and processes inside
      your mind. This wonderful capacity &mdash; to think about thoughts
      as though they were things &mdash; is also what enables us to
      contemplate the products of our thoughts. Without that ability to
      reflect, we would have no general intelligence &mdash; however large
      our repertoire of special-purpose skills might grow. Of course this
      same capacity enables us to think such empty thoughts as <em>This
	statement is about itself,</em> which is true but useless,
      or <em>This statement is not about itself,</em> which is false and
      useless, or <em>This statement is false,</em> which is downright
      paradoxical.  Yet the benefit of being able to conceptualize is
      surely worth the risk that we may sometimes be nonsensical.</p>
