<h2>28.5 the mind and the world</h2>

    <p>
      We spend our lives in several realms. The first is the ordinary
      physical world of <em>objects</em> that exist in space and
      time. Objects obey simple laws. When any object moves or changes, we
      can usually account for it in terms of other objects pushing it, or
      else of gravity or wind. We also live in a social realm of persons,
      families, and companies; those entities appear to be ruled by quite
      different kinds of causes and laws.  Whenever a person moves or
      changes, we look for signs of intentions, ambitions, infatuations,
      promises, threats, and the like &mdash; none of which could affect a
      brick. We also live in a psychological realm &mdash; inhabited by
      entities we call by names like <em>meanings,</em> <em>ideas,</em>
      and
      <em>memories.</em> These, too, appear to obey different rules.</p>

    <p>
      The causes in the physical realm seem terribly different from those
      that work in the social and psychological realms &mdash; so
      different that they seem to belong to different worlds In some
      respects our bodies act exactly like ordinary objects: they have
      shapes we can see and touch, and they have locations that change
      when we&#39;re dropped or pushed. Yet in other ways, our bodies act
      quite differently from other things, and this appears to be because
      of minds. But what on earth are minds? For ages people have wondered
      about the relationship between the mind and body; some philosophers
      became so desperate as to suggest that only the mental world is real
      and the real world is merely an illusion. (That idea just makes the
      problem worse, because it can&#39;t even explain why there seems to
      be a physical world.) Most thinkers have ended up with images that
      portray two different kinds of worlds, one of matter and one of
      mind, somehow connected by mysterious threads of spiritual
      causality, somewhat like the films and tendrils formed when sticky
      stuff is pulled apart. Certain modern physicists have even
      speculated that these connections are somehow involved with
      the <em>uncertainty principle</em> in physics, perhaps because that
      problem also confounds their usual conceptions of causality. I see
      no merit in such ideas because as far as I&#39;m concerned, the
      so-called problem of body and mind does not hold any mystery:</p>

    <p>
      Minds are simply what brains do.</p>

    <p>
      Whenever we speak about a mind, we&#39;re speaking of the processes
      that carry our brains from state to state. And this is what makes
      minds appear to us so separate from their physical embodiments: it
      is because concerns about minds are really concerns with
      relationships between states &mdash; and this has virtually nothing
      to do with the natures of the states themselves. This is why we can
      understand how a society of agents like Builder will work without
      knowing the physical constitution of its agents: what happens
      depends only on how each agent changes its state in response to its
      previous state and those of the other agents that connect to it.
      Other than that, it does not matter in the least what are the
      individual agents&#39; colors, sizes, shapes, or any other
      properties that we could sense. So naturally minds seem detached
      from physical existence. It doesn&#39;t matter what agents are; it
      only matters what they do &mdash; and what they are connected to.</p>
