<h2>18.7 what is a number?</h2>

    <p>
      Why do we find it so hard to explain the meanings of things?
      Because what something <em>means</em> depends upon each different
      person&#39;s state of mind. If so, you might suspect that nothing
      means exactly the same thing to any two different persons. But if
      that were the case, where could you start? If every meaning in a
      person&#39;s mind depended on all the other meanings there,
      wouldn&#39;t everything go in circles? And if you couldn&#39;t break
      into those circles, wouldn&#39;t it all become too subjective to
      make good science? No. There is nothing wrong with phenomena in
      which many things depend on one another. And you don&#39;t have to
      be in those circles in order to understand them; you simply have to
      make good theories about them. It is a pleasant dream to imagine
      things being defined so perfectly that different people could
      understand things in exactly the same ways. But that ideal can&#39;t
      be achieved, because in order for two minds to agree perfectly, at
      every level of detail, they&#39;d have to be identical.</p>

    <p>
      The closest we can come to agreeing on meanings is in mathematics,
      when we talk of things like <em>Three</em> and <em>Five.</em> But
      even something as impersonal as <em>Five</em> never stands isolated
      in a person&#39;s mind but becomes part of a huge network. For
      example, we sometimes think of
      <em>Five</em> for counting things, as when we recite <em>One, Two,
	Three, Four, Five</em> while taking care l) to touch each thing
      only once, and 2) never to touch anything more than once. One way
      to ensure that is to pick up each thing as it&#39;s counted and
      remove it. Another way is to match a group of things to a certain
      standard set of Five &mdash; such as the fingers of your hand
      &mdash; or to that silent stream of syllables spoken in the
      mind. If, one by one, the things are matched and none are left
      behind, then there were Five. Another way to think of Five is to
      imagine some familiar shape &mdash; a pentagon, an X or V or W, a
      star, or even an airplane:</p>

    <p>
      That way, a child might even come to understand a larger number
      before a smaller one. I actually knew one child who seemed to know
      Six before she knew Five, because she&#39;d played so much with sets
      of triangles and hexagons.</p>

    <p>
      Each number meaning works in different problem worlds. To ask which
      meaning is correct &mdash; to count, match, or put into groups
      &mdash; is foolishness: each method helps the others, and all of
      them together make a mass of skills that grow in power and
      efficiency. The really useful <em>meanings</em> are not the flimsy
      logic chains of definitions, but the much harder-to-express networks
      of ways to remember, compare, and change things. A logic chain can
      break easily, but you get stuck less often when you use a
      cross-connected meaning- network; then, when any sense of meaning
      fails, you simply switch to another sense. Consider, for example,
      how many different Twos a child knows: two hands, two feet, two
      shoes, two socks, and all their interchangeabilities. As for Threes,
      recall the popular children&#39;s tale about three bears. The bears
      themselves are usually perceived as Two and One &mdash; Momma and
      Poppa Bear, plus Baby Bear. But their forbidden porridge bowls are
      seen as quite another sort of Three:</p>

    <p>
      too hot, too cold, and then just right; a compromise between
      extremes.</p>
