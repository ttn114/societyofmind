<h2>22.10 verbal expression</h2>

    <p>
      How easily people can communicate. We listen and speak without the
      slightest sense of what&#39;s involved! One of us expresses an idea,
      the other understands it, and neither thinks anything complicated
      has happened; it seems as natural to talk as it is to walk. Yet both
      simplicities are illusions. To walk, you must engage a vast array of
      agencies to move your body down the street. To talk, you must engage
      a vast array of agencies to build new structures in another
      person&#39;s mind. But how do you know just what to say to affect
      that other person&#39;s agencies?</p>

    <p>
      Let&#39;s suppose that Mary wants to tell Jack something. This means
      there is a certain structure p somewhere inside the network of
      Mary&#39;s agencies &mdash; and that Mary&#39;s language-agency must
      construct a similar structure inside Jack&#39;s mind. To do this,
      Mary will need to speak words that will activate appropriate
      activities inside Jack&#39;s agencies, then correctly link them
      together. How can she do that? Here is what we&#39;ll call
      the <em>re-duplication</em> theory of how we formulate what we say:</p>

    <p>
      Mary proceeds, step by step, to construct a new version of p &mdash;
      call it q &mdash; inside her own mind. In doing this, she will apply
      various memory-control operations to activate certain isonomes and
      polynemes.
      
      As Mary performs each internal operation, her speech-agency selects
      certain corresponding verbal expressions &mdash; and these cause
      similar operations to occur inside Jack. As a result, Jack builds a
      structure similar to q.
      
      To be able to do that, Mary must have learned at least one
      expressive technique that corresponds to each frequently used mental
      operation. And Jack must have learned to recognize those expressive
      techniques &mdash; we&#39;ll call them grammar-tactics &mdash; and
      to use them to activate some corresponding isonomes and polynemes.</p>

    <p>
      To build her new version of p, Mary could employ a goal-achieving
      scheme: she keeps comparing p with the latest version of q, and
      whenever she senses a significant difference, she applies some
      operation to q that removes or reduces the difference. For example,
      if Mary notices that p has an Origin pronome where q lacks one, her
      memory-control system will focus on p&#39;s Origin. In this case, if
      p itself is a motion frame, the usual speech-tactic is to use the
      word <em>from.</em>  Next she must describe the substructure
      attached to p&#39;s Origin pronome. If this were a simple polyneme
      like <em>Boston,</em> Mary&#39;s speech-agency could simply
      pronounce the corresponding word. But if that pronome is assigned to
      some more complicated structure, such as an entire frame, Mary&#39;s
      language-agency must interrupt itself to copy that. This is
      expressed, as we have seen, by using words like
      <em>who</em> or <em>which.</em> In any case, Mary continues this
      difference- duplication process until she senses no significant
      discrepancies between q and p. Of course, what Mary finds
      significant depends on what she <em>wants to say.</em></p>

    <p>
      This <em>re-duplication</em> theory of speech describes only the
      first stages of how we use language. In later stages, the mental
      operations we use to construct q are not always immediately applied
      to pronouncing words. Instead, we learn techniques for storing
      sequences of grammar-tactics temporarily; this makes it possible to
      modify and rearrange our words and sentences before we say
      them. Learning these arts takes a long time: most children need a
      decade or more to complete their language-systems and many keep
      learning, throughout their lives, to sense new sorts of
      discrepancies and discover ways to express them.</p>
