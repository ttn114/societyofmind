<h2>13.7 duplications</h2>

    <p>
      Sometimes when we watch a scene, the wholes we see <em>add up</em>
      exactly to the sum of their separate parts. But other times, we do
      not mind if certain things get counted twice. In the first figure
      below, we divide an arch into body and support with no concern that
      both parts have exactly the same boundaries. In the second figure,
      we seem to see two complete arches, despite the fact that there
      aren&#39;t enough legs to make two separate arches.</p>

    <p>
      Sometimes it is vital to keep track, to count each thing exactly
      once.  But in other situations, no harm will come from counting
      twice. It is efficient to use the same block twice when making
      viaducts for roads for cars. But if we tried to use the same five
      blocks to build two separate bridges, we&#39;d end up
      short. Different kinds of goals require different styles of
      description. When we discussed the concept of More, we saw how each
      child must learn when to describe things in terms of appearance and
      when to think in terms of past experience. The double-arch problem
      also offers a choice of description styles. If you plan to build
      several separate things, you&#39;d better keep count carefully or
      take the risk of running out of parts. But if you do that all the
      time, you&#39;ll miss your chance to make one object serve two
      purposes at once.</p>

    <p>
      We could also formulate this as a choice between structural and
      functional descriptions. Suppose we tried to make a match between
      the structural elements of the double-arch and those of two separate
      block-arches. In one way to do that, we would first assign three
      blocks to each arch &mdash; and then verify that each arch consists
      of a top supported by two blocks that do not touch. Then, of course,
      we&#39;ll only find a single three-block arch. There isn&#39;t any
      second arch, since there are only two blocks left.</p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, we could base our description of the double-arch
      scene on the more functional body-support style of description.
      According to that approach, we must focus first on the most
      <em>essential</em> parts. The most essential part of an arch is its
      top block &mdash; and we do indeed find two blocks that could serve
      as top blocks. Then we need only verify that each of them is
      supported by two blocks that do not touch &mdash; and this is indeed
      the case. In a function-oriented approach, it seems natural to count
      carefully the most essential elements, but merely to verify that the
      functions of the auxiliary elements will somehow be served. The
      functional type of description is easier to adapt to the purposes of
      higher-level agencies.  This doesn&#39;t mean that functional
      descriptions are necessarily better.  They can make it hard to keep
      track of real constraints; hence they have a certain tendency to
      lead toward overoptimistic, wishful thought.</p>
