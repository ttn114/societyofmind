<h1>14 Reformulation</h1>
<h2>14.1 using reformulation</h2>

    <p>
      What can we do when we can&#39;t solve a problem? We can try to find
      a new way to look at it, to describe it in different terms.
      Reformulation is the most powerful way to attempt to escape from
      what seems to be a hopeless situation. Thus, when we couldn&#39;t
      find anything common to all those different kinds of arches, we
      changed our way of looking at them. We moved from the world of
      rigid, geometric block descriptions to a less constrained domain of
      body-support descriptions &mdash; and there we found a way to make a
      uniframe for all of them: a span supported by a pair of legs. But
      think of all the other ways a person might describe an arch.</p>

    <p>
      Aesthetic: A pleasing, shapely form.  Dynamical: The top will fall
      if either leg is removed.  Topological: The arch surrounds a hole in
      space.  Geometrical: The three blocks form an <em>inverted U</em>
      shape.  Architectural: The arch&#39;s top could be the base of
      something else.</p>

    <p>
      Constructional: Place two blocks, then place another across their
      tops.  Circumventional: Can be used as a detour, to go around an
      obstacle.  Transportational: Can be used as a bridge, to go from one
      place to another.</p>

    <p>
      Each of these involves a different <em>realm</em> of thought with
      its own style for describing things. And every different realm of
      thought can bring new kinds of skills to bear on a problem. We each
      learn various ways to reason about paths and obstacles; we each
      learn ways to deal with vertical support; with doors and windows;
      with boxes and bridges and tunnels; with stacks and rows and stairs
      and ramps.</p>

    <p>
      To an outsider, it may seem that a creative inventor (or designer or
      thinker) must possess an endless source of novel ways to deal with
      things. Yet inside the inventor&#39;s mind, that all might stem from
      variations on far fewer themes. Indeed, in that inventor&#39;s view,
      those styles of thought may seem so clear (and those inventions all
      so similar) that the question turns the other way: <em>Why can&#39;t
	outsiders understand how to think about these simple kinds of
	problems?</em> In the long run, the most productive kinds of thought
      are not the methods with which we solve particular problems, but
      those that lead us to formulating useful new kinds of descriptions.</p>

    <p>
      How do we reformulate? Each new technique presumably begins by
      exploiting methods already learned in other, older agencies. So new
      ideas often have roots in older ones, adapted for new purposes. In
      the next section, we&#39;ll see how that body-support idea has
      counterparts in virtually every realm of thought. Toward the end of
      this book, we&#39;ll speculate about how those various realms
      themselves evolve inside the mind.</p>

    <p>
      We were able to uniframe many kinds of arches by dividing each into
      a Body and a Support. See how well that technique works on many
      other sorts of things.</p>

    <p>
      What makes such simple cuts seem meaningful? It is because we can
      imagine purposes for each. In everyday life, there is a special
      significance to dividing a table into <em>top</em>
      and <em>legs.</em> This is because the tabletop serves our principal
      use for a table, as <em>thing to put things on.</em> The table&#39;s
      legs serve only secondary purposes: without those legs, the top
      would fall &mdash; but without its top, the table has no use at
      all. And it would make no sense to imagine dividing that table in
      half, vertically, to see it as two stuck-together, L-shaped parts.</p>

    <p>
      This must be one reason why the body-support idea seems so
      universal. It is not merely a matter of physical support: the more
      profound idea is that of building a mental bridge between a thing
      and a purpose. This is why bridge-definitions are so useful: they
      help us connect structural descriptions to psychological goals. But
      the point is that it is not enough just to link together
      descriptions from two different worlds &mdash; <em>top supported by
	legs</em> and <em>thing to put things on.</em>  It is not enough
      simply to know that tables keep things off the floor.  To use that
      knowledge, we must also know how it is done: that things have to be
      put on the table, rather than, for example, between the table&#39;s
      legs.</p>

    <p>
      This is where the body-support representation helps us to classify
      our knowledge. The <em>body</em> represents those parts of a
      structure that serve as the direct instrument for reaching the goals
      and the
      <em>support</em> represents all the other features that merely serve
      that instrument. Once we can classify the tabletop as
      the <em>body</em> of the table, we will tend to think only of using
      the tabletop for keeping things off the floor. Of course, we would
      gain even more power by understanding how those supports assist the
      body&#39;s goal; that is, by understanding that the table&#39;s legs
      are for keeping the tabletop itself away from the floor. A good way
      to understand that is to have a representation of what might happen
      if one of the table&#39;s legs failed to perform its function.</p>

      To understand how something works, it helps to know how it can fail.</p>
