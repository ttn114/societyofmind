<h2>16.2 mental growth</h2>

    <p>
      In ancient times it was believed that the newborn mind started out
      just like a full-grown mind, except for not yet being filled with
      ideas.  Thus children were seen as ignorant adults, conceived with
      all their future aptitudes. Today, there are many different
      views. Some modern theories see a baby&#39;s mind as starting with a
      single Self whose problem is to learn to distinguish itself from the
      rest of the world. Others see the infant&#39;s mind as a place
      containing a horde of mind-fragments, mixed together in a
      disconnected and incoherent confusion in which each must learn to
      interact and cooperate with the others so that they can grow
      together to form a more coherent whole.  Yet another image sees the
      child&#39;s mind as growing through a series of layerlike
      construction stages in which new levels of machinery are based and
      built upon the older ones.</p>

    <p>
      How do our minds form? Is every person born containing a hidden,
      built-in intellect just waiting to reveal itself? Or must minds grow
      in little steps from emptiness? The theories of the next few
      sections will combine ingredients from both these
      conceptions. We&#39;ll start by envisioning a simple brain composed
      of separate <em>proto-specialists,</em> each concerned with some
      important requirement, goal, or instinct, like food, drink, shelter,
      comfort, or defense. But there are reasons why those systems must be
      merged. On one side, we need administrative agencies to resolve
      conflicts between the separate specialists. On the other side, each
      specialist must be able to exploit whatever knowledge the others
      gain.</p>

    <p>
      For a relatively simple animal, a loose-knit league of nearly
      separate agencies with built-in goals might suffice for surviving in
      a suitable environment. But human minds don&#39;t merely learn new
      ways to reach old goals; we can also learn new kinds of goals. This
      enables us to live within a broader range of possible environments,
      but that versatility comes with its own dangers. If we could learn
      new goals without constraint, we&#39;d soon fall prey to accidents
      &mdash; both in the world and inside our own minds. At the simplest
      levels, we have to be protected against such accidents as learning
      not to breathe. On higher levels, we need protection against
      acquiring lethal goals like learning to suppress our other goals
      entirely &mdash; the way that certain saints and mystics do. What
      sorts of built-in self-constraints could guide a mind toward goals
      that will not cause it to destroy itself?</p>

    <p>
      No possible inheritance of built-in genes can tell us what is good
      for us &mdash; because, unlike all other animals, we humans make for
      ourselves most of the problems we face. Accordingly, each human
      individual must learn new goals from what we call the traditions and
      heritages of our peers and predecessors. Consequently our genes must
      build some sort of <em>general-purpose</em> machinery through which
      individuals can acquire and transmit goals and values from one
      generation to another. How could brain-machines transfer things like
      values and goals? The next few sections suggest that this is done by
      exploiting the kinds of personal relationships we call emotional,
      such as fear and affection, attachment and dependency, or hate and
      love.</p>
