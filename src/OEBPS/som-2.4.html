<h2>2.4 Holes and parts</h2>

      <blockquote>
	It has been the persuasion of an immense majority of human
	beings that sensibility and thought [as distinguished from
	matter] are, in their own nature, less susceptible of division
	and decay, and that, when the body is resolved into its
	elements, the principle which animated it will remain
	perpetual and unchanged. However, it is probable that what we
	call thought is not an actual being, but no more than the
	relation between certain parts of that infinitely varied mass,
	of which the rest of the universe is composed, and which
	ceases to exist as soon as those parts change their position
	with respect to each other.
	<cite>&mdash;Percy Bysshe Shelley</cite>

    <p>
      What is Life? One dissects a body but finds no life inside. What is
      Mind? One dissects a brain but finds no mind therein. Are life and mind
      so much more than the <em>sum of their parts</em> that it is useless to
      search for them? To answer that, consider this parody of a conversation
      between a Holist and an ordinary Citizen.</p>

    <p>
      Holist: <em>I&#39;ll prove no box can hold a mouse. A box is made by
        nailing six boards together. But it&#39;s obvious that no box can hold
        a mouse unless it has some &lsquo;mousetightness&rsquo; or
        &lsquo;containment.&rsquo; Now, no single board contains any
        containment, since the mouse can just walk away from it. And if there
        is no containment in one board, there can&#39;t be any in six
        boards. So the box can have no mousetightness at all. Theoretically,
        then, the mouse can escape!</em></p>

    <p>
      Citizen: <em>Amazing. Then what does keep a mouse in a box?</em></p>

    <p>
      Holist: <em>Oh, simple. Even though it has no real mouse- tightness, a
        good box can &lsquo;simulate&rsquo; it so well that the mouse is
        fooled and can&#39;t figure out how to escape.</em></p>

    <p>
      What, then, keeps the mouse confined? Of course, it is the way a box
      prevents motion in all directions, because each board bars escape in a
      certain direction. The left side keeps the mouse from going left, the
      right from going right, the top keeps it from leaping out, and so
      on. The secret of a box is simply in how the boards are arranged to
      prevent motion in all directions!</p>

    <p>
      That&#39;s what containing means. So it&#39;s silly to expect any
      separate board by itself to contain any containment, even though each
      contributes to the containing. It is like the cards of a straight flush
      in poker: only the full hand has any value at all.</p>

    <p>
      The same applies to words like life and mind. It is foolish to use these
      words for describing the smallest components of living things because
      these words were invented to describe how larger assemblies interact.
      Like boxing-in, words like living and thinking are useful for describing
      phenomena that result from certain combinations of relationships.  The
      reason box seems nonmysterious is that everyone understands how the
      boards of a well-made box interact to prevent motion in any
      direction. In fact, the word life has already lost most of its mystery
      &mdash; at least for modern biologists, because they understand so many
      of the important interactions among the chemicals in cells. But mind
      still holds its mystery &mdash; because we still know so little about
      how mental agents interact to accomplish all the things they do.</p>
