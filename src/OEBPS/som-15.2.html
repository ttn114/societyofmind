<h2>15.2 self-examination</h2>

    <p>
      What do we mean by words
      like <em>sentience,</em> <em>consciousness,</em> or
      <em>self-awareness</em>? They all seem to refer to the sense of
      feeling one&#39;s mind at work &mdash; but beyond that, it is hard
      to say whether there are any differences in what they mean. For
      instance, suppose that you had just smiled, and someone asked if you
      had been conscious of this.  It would scarcely matter how that
      question was posed:</p>

    <p>
      <em>Did you just smile?</em>
      <em>Do you realize that you just smiled?</em>
      <em>Do you remember smiling?</em>
      <em>Were you conscious of doing so?</em>
      <em>Were you aware of it?</em></p>

    <p>
      Each of these questions really asks what you can say about your
      recent mental past. In order for you to reply truthfully, <em>Yes, I
	know I smiled,</em> your speaking-agencies must use some records
      about the recent activity of certain agents. But what about all the
      other activities involved in everything you say and do? If you were
      truly self-aware, wouldn&#39;t you know all those other things as
      well? There is a common myth that what we view as consciousness is
      measurelessly deep and powerful &mdash; yet actually, we scarcely
      know a thing about what happens in the great computers of our
      brains. How can we think, not knowing what it is to think? How can
      we get such good ideas, yet not be able to say what ideas are or how
      they&#39;re made?</p>

    <p>
      Why is it so hard to talk about our present state of mind? We&#39;ve
      already seen several reasons for this. one is that the time-delays
      between the different parts of a mind mean that the concept of
      a <em>present state</em> is not psychologically sound. Another
      reason is that each attempt to reflect upon our mental state will
      change that state, and this means that trying to know our state is
      like photographing something that is moving too fast: such pictures
      will always be blurred. In any case, we aren&#39;t much concerned in
      the first place with learning how to describe our mental states;
      instead, we&#39;re more engaged with practical things, like making
      plans and carrying them out.</p>

    <p>
      How much genuine self-insight is possible for us? I&#39;m sure our
      memory-machinery provides some useful clues, if only we could learn
      to interpret them. But it is unlikely that any part of the mind can
      ever obtain complete descriptions of what happens in the other
      parts, because, it seems, our memory-control systems have too little
      temporary memory even to represent their own activities in much
      detail.</p>
