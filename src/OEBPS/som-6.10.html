<h2>6.10 worlds out of mind</h2>

    <p>
      There is no singularly real world of thought; each mind evolves its own
      internal universe. The worlds of thought that we appear to like the best
      are those where goals and actions seem to mesh in regions large enough
      to spend our lives in &mdash; and thus become a Buddhist, or Republican,
      or poet, or topologist. Some mental starting points grow into great,
      coherent continents. In certain parts of mathematics, science, and
      philosophy, a relatively few but clear ideas may lead into an endless
      realm of complex yet consistent new structures. Yet even in mathematics,
      a handful of seemingly innocent rules can lead to complications far
      beyond our grasp. Thus we feel we understand perfectly the rules of
      addition and multiplication &mdash; yet when we mix them together, we
      encounter problems about prime numbers that have remained unsolved for
      centuries.</p>

    <p>
      Minds also make up pleasant worlds of practical affairs &mdash; which
      work because we make them work, by putting things in order there. In the
      physical realm, we keep our books and clothes in self-made shelves and
      cabinets &mdash; thus building artificial boundaries to keep our things
      from interacting very much. Similarly, in mental realms, we make up
      countless artificial schemes to force things to seem orderly, by
      specifying legal codes, grammar rules and traffic laws. When growing up
      in such a world, it all seems right and natural &mdash; and only
      scholars and historians recall the mass of precedents and failed
      experiments it took to make it work so well. These <em>natural</em>
      worlds are actually more complex than the technical worlds of
      philosophy.  They&#39;re far too vast to comprehend &mdash; except where
      we impose on them the rules we make.</p>

    <p>
      There is also a different and more sinister way to make the world seem
      orderly, in which the mind has merely found a way to simplify
      itself. This is what we must suspect whenever some idea seems to explain
      too much. Perhaps no problem was actually solved at all; instead, the
      mind has merely found some secondary pathway in the brain, through which
      one can mechanically dislodge each doubt and difference from its
      rightful place! This may be what happens in some of those experiences
      that leave a person with a sense of revelation &mdash; in a state in
      which no doubts remain, or with a vision of astounding clarity &mdash;
      yet unable to recount any details. Some accident of mental stress has
      temporarily suppressed the capacity to question, doubt, or probe. One
      remembers that no questions went unanswered but forgets that none were
      asked! One can acquire certainty only by amputating inquiry.</p>

    <p>
      When victims of these incidents become compelled to recapture them,
      their lives and personalities are sometimes permanently changed.  Then
      others, seeing the radiance in their eyes and hearing of the glory to be
      found, are drawn to follow them. But to offer hospitality to paradox is
      like leaning toward a precipice. You can find out what it is like by
      falling in, but you may not be able to fall out again. Once
      contradiction finds a home, few minds can spurn the sense-destroying
      force of slogans such as <em>all is one.</em></p>
