<h2>27.6 humor and censorship</h2>

    <p>
      People often wonder if a computer could ever have a sense of humor.
      This question seems natural to those who think of humor as a
      pleasant but unnecessary luxury. But I&#39;ll argue quite the
      opposite &mdash; that humor has a practical and possibly essential
      function in how we learn.</p>

    <p>
      When we learn in a serious context, the result is to change
      connections among ordinary agents. But when we learn in a humorous
      context, the principal result is to change the connections that
      involve our censors and suppressors.</p>

    <p>
      In other words, my theory is that humor is involved with how our
      censors learn; it is mainly involved with <em>negative</em>
      thinking, though people rarely realize this. Why use such a distinct
      and peculiar medium as humor for this purpose? Because we must make
      a sharp distinction between our positive, action-oriented memories
      and the negative, inhibitory memories embodied in our censors.</p>

    <p>
      Positive memory-agents must learn which mental states are desirable.
      Negative memory-agents must learn which mental states are
      undesirable.</p>

    <p>
      Because these two types of learning required different processes, it
      was natural to evolve social signals to communicate that
      distinction. When people do things that we regard as good, we speak
      to them in encouraging tones &mdash; and this switches on their
      positive learning machinery. However, when people do things we
      consider stupid or wrong, we then complain in scornful tones or
      laugh derisively; this switches on their negative learning
      machinery. I suspect that scolding and laughing have somewhat
      different effects: scolding tends to produce suppressors, but
      laughing tends to produce censors.  Accordingly, the effect of
      derisive humor is somewhat more likely to disrupt our present
      activity. This is because the process of constructing a censor
      deprives us of the use of our temporary memories, which must be
      frozen to maintain the records of our recent states of mind.</p>

    <p>
      Suppressors merely need to learn which mental states are
      undesirable.  Censors must remember and learn which mental states
      were undesirable.</p>

    <p>
      To see why humor is so often concerned with prohibition, consider
      that our most productive forms of thought are just the ones most
      subject to mistakes. We can make fewer errors by confining ourselves
      to cautious, <em>logical</em> reasoning, but we&#39;ll also discover
      fewer new ideas.  More can be gained by using metaphors and
      analogies, even though they are often defective and misleading. I
      think this is why so many jokes are based on recognizing
      inappropriate comparisons. Why, by the way, do we so rarely
      recognize the negative character of humor itself?  Perhaps it has a
      funny side effect: while shutting off those censored thoughts, our
      censors also shut off thoughts about themselves &mdash; and make
      themselves invisible.</p>

    <p>
      This solves Freud&#39;s problem about nonsense jokes. The taboos
      that grow within social communities can be learned only from other
      people.  But when it comes to intellectual mistakes, a child needs
      no helpful friend to scold it when a tower falls, when it puts a
      spoon in its ear, or thinks a thought that sets its mind into a
      fruitless and confusing loop. In other words, we can detect many of
      our own intellectual failures all by ourselves. Freud&#39;s theory
      of jokes was based on the idea that censors suppress thoughts that
      would be considered
      <em>naughty</em> by those to whom we are attached. He must simply
      have overlooked the fact that ineffectual reasoning is equally
      <em>naughty</em> &mdash; and therefore equally <em>funny</em>
      &mdash; in the sense that it, too, ought to be suppressed. There is
      no need for our censors to distinguish between social incompetence
      and intellectual stupidity.</p>
