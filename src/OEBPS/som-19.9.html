<h2>19.9 recognizing thoughts</h2>

    <p>
      How do we recognize our own ideas? At first, that must seem a
      strange question. But consider two different situations. In the
      first case, I hold up an apple and ask, <em>What is this?</em>
      We&#39;ve already seen how such a sight could lead to activating
      polynemes for words like
      <em>apple</em> or <em>fruit.</em> In the second case, there is no
      apple on the scene, and I ask instead, <em>What do we call those
	round, red, thin-peeled fruits?</em> Yet this time, too, you end up
      with an apple thought. Isn&#39;t it remarkable that one
      can <em>recognize</em> a thing merely from hearing words? What is
      there in common to our recognizing things in two such different
      ways? The answer is that inside the brain, these situations really
      aren&#39;t so different. In neither case is there a real apple in
      the brain. In both cases, some part of mind must recognize
      what&#39;s happening in certain other parts of mind.</p>

    <p>
      Let&#39;s pursue this example and imagine that those words have
      caused three partial states to become active among your
      agencies. Your Taste agency is in the condition corresponding to
      apple taste, your Physical Structure agency is representing
      thin-peeled, and your Substance agency is in the state that
      corresponds to fruit. Thus, even though there is no apple in sight,
      this combination would probably activate one of your <em>apple</em>
      polynemes. Let&#39;s call them <em>apple-nemes</em> for short. How
      could we make a machine do that? We would simply attach another
      recognizer to the apple-neme, a recognizer whose inputs come from
      memories instead of from the sensory world.</p>

    <p>
      In a limited sense, such an agent could be said to recognize a
      certain state of mind or &mdash; if we dare to use the phrase
      &mdash; a certain combination of ideas. In this sense, both physical
      and mental objects could engage similar representations and
      processes. As we accumulate these recognizers, each agency will need
      a second kind of memory &mdash; a sort of recognition dictionary of
      recognizers to recognize its various states.</p>

    <p>
      This simple scheme can explain only a little of how we represent
      ideas, since only certain things can be described by such simple
      lists of properties. We usually need additional information about
      constraints and relationships among the parts of things &mdash; for
      example, to represent the knowledge that the wheels of a car must be
      mounted underneath its body. To discover how we might represent such
      things is becoming a major concern of modern research in both
      psychology and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
