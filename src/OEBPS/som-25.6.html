<h2>25.6 the frame idea</h2>

    <p>
      I first conceived the idea of frames in the early 1970s, while
      working on making a robot that could see, and I described the theory
      in a 1974 essay entitled <em>A Framework for Representing
	Knowledge.</em> The essay influenced the next decade of research on
      Artificial Intelligence, despite the fact that most readers
      complained that its explanations were too vague. In retrospect, it
      seems those explanations were at just the right level-bands of
      detail to meet the needs of that time, which is why the essay had
      the effect it did. If the theory had been any vaguer, it would have
      been ignored, but if it had been described in more detail, other
      scientists might have <em>tested</em> it, instead of contributing
      their own ideas. Then they might have found my proposals were
      inadequate. Instead, many versions were suggested by other people,
      and <em>frame-based</em> programming became popular.</p>

    <p>
      Two students in particular, Scott Fahlman and Ira Goldstein, claimed
      to understand what I had meant &mdash; and then explained many
      details I hadn&#39;t imagined at all. Another student, Terry
      Winograd, worked on making a robot that understood a certain class
      of English-language sentences; this led to important theories about
      the relation between grammar and its effect upon a listener. Then,
      since that robot&#39;s task was building towers of children&#39;s
      blocks, Winograd also worked out many details of how to make a
      Builder. You can see how his theories affected this book. Yet
      another student, Eugene Charniak, worked on the problem of how young
      children understand the stories they read.  He spent at least a
      solid year thinking about one such story, which had to do with
      bringing a kite to a birthday party. Shortly, you&#39;ll see the
      influence Charniak had on this book.</p>

    <p>
      All along, I had felt that the frame idea itself was rather obvious
      and perhaps implicit in the earlier work of psychologists like
      Bartlett. I considered the more important concept in the 1974 essay
      to be the idea of a frame-system &mdash;
      renamed <em>frame-array</em> in this book. I was surprised that the
      frame idea became popular while the frame-array idea did not. The
      neme concept emerged in 1977 (under the term <em>C-lines</em>); the
      K-line idea crystallized in 1979. The concept of pronomes was in my
      unconscious mind for several years but did not crystallize until,
      while writing this book, I realized how to reformulate several of
      Roger Schank&#39;s early ideas into the form of Trans-frames. The
      scheme proposed in this book, in which the frame-terminals are
      controlled by bundles of nemes or isonomes, did not emerge until a
      full decade after the original concept of a frame-array.</p>

    <p>
      Many questions remain about how frames might work. For example, it
      should be possible to recognize several different things at once by
      using different frames in parallel. But how can we see many faces in
      a crowd at once, or bricks in a wall, or chairs in a room? Do we
      make many copies of the same frame? I suspect that&#39;s
      impractical. Instead, perhaps we match each frame only to one
      example at a time &mdash; and simply assume that the same frame also
      applies to every other visible object that shares some
      characteristic features with the object under attention.</p>
