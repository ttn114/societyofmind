<h1>12 Learning Meaning</h1>
<h2>12.1 a block-arch scenario</h2>

    <p>
      Our child, playing with some blocks and a toy car, happens to build
      this structure. Let&#39;s call it a Block-Arch.</p>

    <p>
      Block-Arch seems to cause a strange new phenomenon: when you push
      the car through it, your arm gets trapped! Then, in order to
      complete that action, you must release the car &mdash; and reach
      around to the other side of the arch, perhaps by changing hands. The
      child becomes interested in this <em>Hand-Change</em> phenomenon and
      wonders how Block-Arch causes it. Soon the child finds another
      structure that seems similar &mdash; except that Hand-Change
      disappears because you can&#39;t even push the car through it. Yet
      both structures fit the same description!</p>

    <p>
      But if Block-Arch causes Hand-Change, then this can&#39;t be a
      block-arch.  So the child must find some way to change the mental
      description of Block-Arch so it won&#39;t apply to this. What is the
      difference between them? Perhaps this is because those standing
      blocks now touch one another, when they didn&#39;t touch before. We
      could adapt to this by changing our description of
      Block-Arch: <em>There must be two standing blocks and a lying
	block. The standing blocks must not touch.</em> But even this does
      not suffice, because the child soon finds yet another structure that
      matches this description. Here, too, the Hand-Change phenomenon has
      disappeared; now you can push the car through it without letting go!</p>

    <p>
      Again we must change our description to keep this from being
      considered a Block-Arch. Finally the child discovers another
      variation that does produce Hand-Change:</p>

    <p>
      Our child has constructed for itself a useful conception of an arch,
      based entirely upon its own experience.</p>
