<h2>24.5 nonverbal reasoning</h2>

    <p>
      Even when you were very young, if someone had told you that most
      Snarks are green &mdash; and, also, that every Boojum is a Snark
      &mdash; you would have been able to conclude that most Boojums are
      green. What could have led you to that conclusion? Presumably, you
      answer questions about the properties of Boojums by attaching your
      polyneme for Snark to whichever of your memory-units currently
      represents a Boojum. Accordingly, you assume that the color property
      of a Boojum is green by using your usual way of recalling the
      properties of things you know &mdash; activating their polynemes to
      set your various agencies into the corresponding states. In other
      words, we do this kind of reasoning by manipulating our memories to
      replace particular things by typical things. I mention all this
      because it is often assumed that adults are better than children are
      at what is often called abstract or logical reasoning. This idea is
      unfair both to adult and child because logical thinking is so much
      simpler &mdash; and less effective &mdash; than common-sense
      thinking. Actually, what appears to be a matter of <em>logic</em> is
      usually not logical at all and frequently turns out to be wrong. In
      the case above, you would have been wrong because Boojums are albino
      Snarks.</p>

    <p>
      The situation is different when you happen to know more about a
      particular example. For example, suppose you first had learned that
      penguins cannot fly and then learned that penguins are a kind of
      bird.  When you discover that, should you replace all of your
      penguin properties with those of your <em>generic</em> bird? Clearly
      not, since then you&#39;d lose your hard-earned penguin facts. To
      deal with this effectively, children must develop complex skills,
      not merely to replace one representation with another, but to
      compare two representations and then move around inside them, making
      different changes at different levels. These intricate skills
      involve the use of isonomes that control the level-band of the
      activities inside our agencies.</p>

    <p>
      In any case, to reason well, our memory-control agencies must learn
      to <em>move</em> our memories around as though those memories were
      building-blocks. Conceivably, those agencies have to learn such
      skills before we can learn to build with blocks in the outside world
      of object-things. Unfortunately, we know very little about how such
      processes work. Indeed, we&#39;re virtually unaware that they even
      exist, because these kinds of <em>commonsense</em> inferences and
      assumptions come to mind without the slightest conscious effort or
      activity.  Perhaps this unawareness is a consequence of the speed
      with which those skills employ the very same short-term memory-units
      that might otherwise be used to record those agents&#39; own recent
      activities.</p>
