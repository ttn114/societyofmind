<h2>14.6 parts and holes</h2>

    <p>
      As an example of reformulation, we&#39;ll represent the concept of a
      box in the form of a machine that has a goal. We can use this to
      understand the Hand-Change phenomenon. What makes a Block-Arch trap
      a person&#39;s arm so that there&#39;s no way to escape except to
      withdraw? One way to explain this is to imagine the arch as made of
      four potential obstacles &mdash; that is, if we include the floor.</p>

    <p>
      An obstacle is an object that interferes with the goal of moving in
      a certain direction. To be trapped is to be unable to move in any
      acceptable direction. Why does the block-arch form a trap? The
      simplest explanation is that each of its four sides is a separate
      obstacle that keeps us from escaping in a certain direction. (For
      our present purposes, we&#39;ll regard moving the hand forward or
      backward as unacceptable.) Therefore we&#39;re trapped, since there
      are only four acceptable directions &mdash; up, down, left, or right
      &mdash; and each of them is separately blocked. Psychologically,
      however, there&#39;s something missing in that explanation: it
      doesn&#39;t quite describe our sense of being trapped. When
      you&#39;re caught inside a box, you feel as though something is
      trying to keep you there. The box seems more than just its separate
      sides; you don&#39;t feel trapped by any particular side. It seems
      more like a conspiracy in which each obstacle is made more effective
      because of how all the other obstacles work together to keep you
      from going around it. In the next section we&#39;ll assemble an
      agency that represents this active sense of frustration by showing
      how those obstacles cooperate to keep you in.</p>

    <p>
      In order to represent this concept of trap or enclosure, we&#39;ll
      first need a way to represent the idea of a container. To simplify
      matters, instead of trying to deal with a genuine, six-sided,
      three-dimensional boxlike container, we&#39;ll consider only a
      two-dimensional, four-sided rectangle. This will let us continue to
      use our Block-Arch uniframe, together with that extra side to
      represent the floor.</p>

    <p>
      Why focus so sharply on the concept of a container? Because without
      that concept, we could scarcely understand the structure of the
      spatial world. Indeed, every normal child spends a great deal of
      time learning about space-surrounding shapes &mdash; as physical
      implements for containing, protecting, or imprisoning objects. But
      the same idea is also important not only physically, but
      psychologically, as a mental implement for envisioning and
      understanding other, more complicated structures. This is because
      the idea of a set of <em>all possible directions</em> is one of the
      great, coherent, cross-realm correspondences that can be used in
      many different realms of thought.</p>
