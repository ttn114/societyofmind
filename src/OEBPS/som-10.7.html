<h2>10.7 the concept of concept</h2>

    <p>
      In learning their Societies-of-More, children learn various skills
      for comparing different qualities and quantities, like number and
      extent.  It is tempting to try to summarize all that by saying that
      the children are learning something; we could call it the concept of
      quantity. But why do we feel we have to think of what we learn as
      things or concepts?  Why must we <em>thingify</em> everything?</p>

    <p>
      What is a thing? No one doubts that a child&#39;s building-block is
      a thing. But is a child&#39;s love for its mother also
      a <em>thing</em>? We&#39;re imprisoned by our poverty of words
      because even though we have good ways to describe objects and
      actions, we lack methods for describing dispositions and
      processes. We can scarcely speak of what minds do except as though
      they were filled with things that one could see or touch; that&#39;s
      why we cling to terms like <em>concepts</em> and <em>ideas.</em>  I
      don&#39;t mean to say that this is always bad,
      for <em>thing-ifying</em> is indeed a splendid mental
      instrument. But for our present purpose, it is disastrous to assume
      that our minds contain some single <em>concept of quantity.</em> At
      different times, a word like <em>more</em> can mean many different
      kinds of things. Think about each of these expressions.</p>

    <p>
      More colorful. More loud. More swift. More valuable. More
      complicated.</p>

    <p>
      We speak as though these were similar, yet each of them involves a
      different, hard-earned web of ways to think! The phrase <em>more
	loud</em> might seem at first to be merely a matter of
      magnitude. But consider how the sound of a distant gong seems louder
      than a whisper near the ear &mdash; no matter that its actual
      intensity is less. Your reaction to what you hear depends not only
      on its physical intensity, but also on what your agencies conclude
      about the character of its source. Thus you can usually tell whether
      a gong is loud but distant, rather than soft but close, by
      unconsciously making assumptions about the origin of that sound. And
      all those other kinds of <em>more</em> engage equally subtle sorts
      of expertise.</p>

    <p>
      Instead of assuming that our children come to crystallize a single
      <em>concept of quantity,</em> we must try to discover how our
      children accumulate and classify their many methods for comparing
      things.  How do agents like Tall, Thin, Short, and Wide get formed
      into subagencies? To an adult, it seems natural to associate both
      being taller and being wider with being larger. But what prevents
      the child from inventing senseless <em>concepts</em> such
      as <em>being Green and Tall and having recently been touched</em>?
      No child has the time to generate and test all possible combinations
      to find which ones are sensible. Life is too short to do that many
      bad experiments! The secret is: always try to combine related agents
      first. Tall, Thin, Short, and Wide are all closely related, because
      they are all concerned with making comparisons between spatial
      qualities. In fact, they probably involve agencies that are close to
      one another in the brain and share so many agents in common that
      they&#39;ll naturally seem similar.</p>
