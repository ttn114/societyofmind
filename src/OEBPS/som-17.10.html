<h2>17.10 intellectual trauma</h2>
<!--img class="illus" src="./illus/ch17/17-7.png"/!-->

  <blockquote>If the mind were an ego-personality, it could do this
  and that as it would determine, but the mind often flies from what
  it knows is right and chases after evil reluctantly. Still, nothing
  seems to happen exactly as ego desires. It is simply the mind
  clouded over by impure desires, and impervious to wisdom, which
  stubbornly persists in thinking of &ldquo;me&rdquo; and
  &ldquo;mine&rdquo;.

      One of Freud&#39;s conceptions was that the growth of many
      individuals is shaped by unsuspected fears that lurk in our
      unconscious minds.  These powerful anxieties include the dread of
      punishment or injury or helplessness or, worst of all, the loss of
      the esteem of those to whom we are attached. Whether this is true or
      not, most psychologists who hold this view apply it only to the
      social realm, assuming that the world of intellect is too
      straightforward and impersonal to be involved with such
      feelings. But intellectual development can depend equally upon
      attachments to other persons and can be similarly involved with
      buried fears and dreads.</p>

    <p>
      Later, when we discuss the nature of humor and jokes, we&#39;ll see
      that many of the consequences of both social and intellectual
      failures are rather similar. A major difference is that in the
      social world, only other persons can inform us about our violations
      of taboos &mdash; whereas within the realm of intellect, we can
      often detect our own deficiencies.</p>

    <p>
      A tower-building child needs no teacher to complain when a misplaced
      block spoils all the work. Nor does a thinking child&#39;s mind need
      anyone to tell it when some paradox engulfs and whirls it into a
      frightening cyclone. By itself, the failure to achieve a goal can
      cause anxiety. For example, surely every child must once have
      thought along this line:</p>

    <p>
      Hmmm. Ten is nearly eleven. And eleven is nearly twelve. So ten is
      nearly twelve. And so on. If l keep on reasoning this way, then ten
      must be nearly a hundred!</p>

    <p>
      To an adult, this is just a stupid joke. But earlier in life, such
      an incident could have produced a crisis of self-confidence and
      helplessness. To put it in more grown-up terms, the child might
      think, I can&#39;t see anything wrong with my reasoning &mdash; and
      yet it led to bad results. I merely used the obvious fact that if A
      is near B, and B is near C, then A must be near C. I see no way that
      could be wrong &mdash; so there must be something wrong with my
      mind. Whether or not we can recollect it, we must once have felt
      some distress at being made to sketch the nonexistent boundaries
      between the oceans and the seas.</p>

    <p>
      What was it like to first consider <em>Which came first, the chicken
	or the egg?</em> What came before the start of time; what lies
      beyond the edge of space? And what of sentences like <em>This
	statement is false,</em> which can throw the mind into a spin? I
      don&#39;t know anyone who recalls such incidents as
      frightening. But then, as Freud might say, this very fact could be
      a hint that the area is subject to censorship.</p>

    <p>
      If people bear the scars of scary thoughts, why don&#39;t these
      lead, as our emotion-traumas are supposed to do, to phobias,
      compulsions, and the like? I suspect the answer is that they do
      &mdash; but disguised in forms we don&#39;t perceive as
      pathological. Every teacher knows and loathes how certain children
      turn away from learning things they believe they cannot learn: <em>I
	simply can&#39;t. I&#39;m just no good at that.</em> Sometimes this
      might represent only a learned way to avoid the shame and stress
      that came from social censure of failures in the past. But it might
      equally represent a reaction to the nonsocial stress that came from
      having been unable to deal with certain ideas themselves. Today, we
      generally regard emotional incompetence as an illness to be
      remedied. However, we generally accept incompetence of intellect as
      a normal, if unfortunate, deficiency
      in <em>talents,</em> <em>aptitudes,</em> and</p>

    <p>
      <em>gifts.</em> Accordingly, we say things like <em>That child
	isn&#39;t very bright,</em> as though that person&#39;s poverty of
      thought were part of some predestined fate &mdash; and, therefore,
      isn&#39;t anyone&#39;s fault.</p>
