<h2>20.2 negotiating ambiguity</h2>

    <p>
      Many common words are ambiguous enough that even simple sentences
      can be understood in several ways.</p>

    <p>
      The astronomer married the star.</p>

    <p>
      It probably was a movie star &mdash; though the listener may have
      experienced a moment of confusion. The trouble is that the word
      <em>star</em> is linked to different polynemes for a celestial body,
      a theatrical celebrity, or an object with a certain shape. The
      momentary confusion comes because the word <em>astronomer</em> gives
      us an initial bias toward the celestial sense of <em>star.</em> But
      that inhuman meaning causes conflict in our marriage-agent, and this
      soon leads to another, more consistent interpretation. The problem
      is harder when a sentence contains two or more ambiguous words.</p>

    <p>
      John shot two bucks.</p>

    <p>
      Alone, the word <em>shot</em> could refer either to shooting a gun
      or, in American slang, to making a bet. By itself, the
      word <em>buck</em> could mean either a dollar or a male deer. These
      alternatives permit at least four conceivable interpretations. Two
      of them are quite implausible, because people rarely shoot bullets
      at dollars or bet deer. But the other two are possible, since,
      unfortunately, people do bet dollars and shoot at deer. Without more
      clues, we have no way to choose between these interpretations. Yet
      we wouldn&#39;t have the slightest doubt that <em>buck</em> means
      dollar if the previous context gave a hint that money or gambling
      was involved &mdash; rather than hunting, forestry, or outdoor life.</p>

    <p>
      How do <em>contexts</em> work to clarify such ambiguities? The
      activity of an outdoors polyneme would start by producing a small
      bias for arousing deer rather than dollar and gun instead of
      bet. Then the
      <em>ring-closing</em> effect would swiftly make that preference
      sharp. Other polynemes like those for hunting and killing will soon
      be engaged and will combine to activate the recognizers for yet
      other, related polynemes like those for forest and animal. Soon this
      will produce a collection of mutually supporting polynemes that
      establish a single, consistent interpretation.</p>

    <p>
      One might fear that this would lead, instead, to an avalanche that
      arouses all the agents of the mind. That would be less likely to
      happen if the different possible senses of each word are made to
      compete, by being assembled into cross-exclusion groups. Then, as
      the polynemes for deer and gun gain strength, they will weaken and
      suppress the competing nemes for money and for wagering &mdash; and
      that will weaken, in turn, the other polynemes that support the
      alternative context of making bets. The end effect of this will be
      almost instantaneous. In only a few cycles of the meaning ring, the
      agents associated with deer and gun will completely suppress their
      competitors.</p>
