<h2>7.10 genius</h2>

    <p>
      We naturally admire our Einsteins, Shakespeares, and Beethovens &mdash;
      and we wonder if machines could ever create such wondrous theories,
      plays, and symphonies. Most people think that accomplishments like these
      require <em>talents</em> or <em>gifts</em> that cannot be explained. If
      so, then it follows that computers can&#39;t create such things &mdash;
      since anything machines do can be explained. But why assume that what
      our greatest artists do is very different from what ordinary people do
      &mdash; when we know so little about what ordinary people do! Surely it
      is premature to ask how great composers write great symphonies before we
      know how ordinary people think of ordinary tunes. I don&#39;t believe
      there is much difference between normal and <em>creative</em>
      thought. Right now, if asked which seems the more mysterious, I&#39;d
      have to say the ordinary kind.</p>

    <p>
      We shouldn&#39;t let our envy of distinguished masters of the arts
      distract us from the wonder of how each of us gets new ideas. Perhaps we
      hold on to our superstitions about creativity in order to make our own
      deficiencies seem more excusable. For when we tell ourselves that
      masterful abilities are simply unexplainable, we&#39;re also comforting
      ourselves by saying that those super-heroes come endowed with all the
      qualities we don&#39;t possess. Our failures are therefore no fault of
      our own, nor are those heroes&#39; virtues to their credit, either. If
      it isn&#39;t learned, it isn&#39;t earned.</p>

    <p>
      When we actually meet the heroes whom our culture views as great, we
      don&#39;t find any singular propensities &mdash; only combinations of
      ingredients quite common in themselves. Most of these heroes are
      intensely motivated, but so are many other people. They&#39;re usually
      very proficient in some field &mdash; but in itself we simply call this
      craftsmanship or expertise. They often have enough self-confidence to
      stand up to the scorn of peers &mdash; but in itself, we might just call
      that stubbornness. They surely think of things in some novel ways, but
      so does everyone from time to time. And as for what we
      call <em>intelligence,</em> my view is that each person who can speak
      coherently already has the better part of what our heroes have. Then
      what makes genius appear to stand apart, if we each have most of what it
      takes?</p>

    <p>
      I suspect that genius needs one thing more: in order to accumulate
      outstanding qualities, one needs unusually effective ways to learn.
      It&#39;s not enough to learn a lot; one also has to manage what one
      learns.  Those masters have, beneath the surface of their mastery, some
      special knacks of <em>higher-order</em> expertise, which help them
      organize and apply the things they learn. It is those hidden tricks of
      mental management that produce the systems that create those works of
      genius. Why do certain people learn so many more and better skills?
      These all-important differences could begin with early accidents. One
      child works out clever ways to arrange some blocks in rows and stacks; a
      second child plays at rearranging how it thinks. Everyone can praise the
      first child&#39;s castles and towers, but no one can see what the second
      child has done, and one may even get the false impression of a lack of
      industry. But if the second child persists in seeking better ways to
      learn, this can lead to silent growth in which some better ways to learn
      may lead to better ways to learn to learn. Then, later, well observe an
      awesome, qualitative change, with no apparent cause &mdash; and give to
      it some empty name like talent, aptitude, or gift.</p>

    <p>
      Finally, an awful thought: perhaps what we call genius is rare because
      our evolution works without respect for individuals. Could any tribe or
      culture endure in which each individual discovered novel ways to think?
      If not, how sad, since the genes for genius might then lead not to
      nurturing, but only to frequent weeding-out.</p>
