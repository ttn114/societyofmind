<h2>15.3 memory</h2>

    <p>
      In order for a mind to think, it has to juggle fragments of its
      mental states. Suppose you want to rearrange the furniture inside a
      room you know. Your attention keeps shifting, first to one corner,
      then to another, next to the center of the room, and then, perhaps,
      to how the light falls on some object on a shelf. Different ideas
      and images interrupt each other. At one moment it seems as though
      your entire mind were focused on one small detail; at another moment
      you might dwell on why you are thinking about that room in the first
      place; then you might find yourself comparing or contrasting two
      different rearrangements of that scene: <em>If that couch were over
	here, there would be room for guests to chat &mdash; but no, that
	would block the path so that they wouldn&#39;t be able to
	enter.</em></p>

    <p>
      How do our various agencies keep track of imaginary changes in
      scenes? Where do the different versions go when out of mind, and how
      do we get them back again? They must be stored as memories.</p>

    <p>
      But what do we mean by that? Some readers may be surprised to learn
      that biologists still have no well-established theory of what
      happens in our brains when memories are formed. Psychologists,
      however, do agree that there must be at least two different
      mechanisms. We appear to have <em>long-term memories,</em> which can
      persist for days or years or all one&#39;s life. We also
      have <em>short-term memories,</em> which last only for seconds or
      minutes. In the next few sections we&#39;ll talk mostly about the
      uses of these transient traces of our recent thoughts. For example,
      whenever we get stuck in the course of solving a problem, we need to
      be able to backtrack, modify our strategy, and try again. To do this
      we need those short-term memories, if only not to repeat the same
      mistake.</p>

    <p>
      How much do we remember? Sometimes we surprise ourselves by
      remembering things we didn&#39;t know we knew. Could this mean that
      we remember everything? Some older theories in psychology have
      supposed this to be true, and there are many legends of persons
      having fabulous abilities. For example, we often hear about people
      with <em>photographic memories</em> that enable them to quickly
      memorize all the fine details of a complicated picture or a page of
      text in a few seconds. So far as I can tell, all of these tales are
      unfounded myths, and only professional magicians or charlatans can
      produce such demonstrations.</p>

    <p>
      In any case, I suspect we never really remember very much about a
      particular experience. Instead, our various agencies selectively
      decide, unconsciously, to transfer only certain states into their
      long-term memories &mdash; perhaps because they have been classified
      as useful, dangerous, unusual, or significant in other respects. It
      would be of little use for us simply to maintain vast stores of
      unclassified memories if, every time we needed one, we had to search
      through all of them. Nor would it be of any use for them all to
      flood at once into our agencies. Instead, each of us must develop
      fruitful and effective ways to organize our memories &mdash; but how
      that&#39;s done is inaccessible to consciousness. What barriers keep
      us from knowing such things?  The next few sections sketch out some
      theories, both about how our memory-systems work and why we
      can&#39;t find this out directly by examining our own thoughts.</p>
