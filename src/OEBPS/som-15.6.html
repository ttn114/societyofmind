<h2>15.6 many kinds of memory</h2>

    <p>
      We often talk of &ldquo;memory&rdquo; as though it were a single
      definite thing.  But everyone has many kinds of memories. Some
      things we know seem totally detached from time, like such facts
      as that twelve inches make a foot or that a bull has dangerous
      horns. Other things we know seem linked to definite spans of
      time or space, like memories of places where we&#39;ve
      lived. Still other recollections seem like souvenirs of episodes
      we can reexperience: <em>Once, when visiting my grand- parents,
      I climbed an old apple tree.</em></p>

    <p>
      A brain has no single, common memory system. Instead, each part of
      the brain has several types of memory-agencies that work in somewhat
      different ways, to suit particular purposes.</p>

    <p>
      Why do we have so many kinds of memory? If memories are records of
      our mental states of earlier times, how are those records stored and
      kept? A popular image of memories is that they are like objects we
      store away in various <em>places</em> in the brain. But then what
      are those places like? How do memories get into them and come out
      again? And what takes place inside of the vaults in which
      they&#39;re stored? Are memory banks like freezer chests where time
      stands still, or do their contents interact? How long can our old
      memories remain; do some of them grow old and die, do they get weak
      and fade away or just get lost and never found?</p>

    <p>
      We have the impression that even our long-term memories become
      harder to recall as time goes on, and that might lead us to suppose
      that they have some inherent tendency to fade away. But even that is
      uncertain; it could simply be because so many other memories begin
      to interfere with them. Most likely, some types of memory mechanisms
      retain the records of sensations only for seconds; we use others to
      adopt habits, goals, and styles that we hold only for days or weeks;
      and we make personal attachments that endure through many months or
      years. Yet suddenly, from time to time, we&#39;ll modify some
      memories that seemed, till then, quite permanent.</p>

    <p>
      More evidence that there are many kinds of memory has come from
      accidental injuries to brains. One injury may cause the loss of
      abilities to deal with names; another injury can make you lose some
      capacity to recognize faces or to remember musical tunes; still
      other kinds of injuries can leave unchanged what you have learned in
      earlier times but keep you from learning anything more in some
      particular domain.  There is evidence that long-term memories can
      never form at all unless their short-term antecedents are permitted
      to persist for certain intervals; this process can also be blocked
      by various drugs and injuries, and this is why some people can never
      recollect what happened in the minutes before a brain concussion.</p>

    <p>
      Finally, it appears that there are strong limitations on how rapidly
      we can construct our long-term memories. Despite all the legends
      about prodigies, there seems to be no evidence from any
      well-designed experiments that any human being can continue to
      construct long-term memories, over any substantial interval of time,
      more than two or three times faster than the average person.</p>
