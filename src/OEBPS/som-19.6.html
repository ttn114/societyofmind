<h2>19.6 recognizers</h2>

    <p>
      When we see an apple, how do we know it as an apple? How do we
      recognize a friend &mdash; or even know when we&#39;re seeing a
      person? How do we recognize things? The simplest way to recognize
      something is to verify that it has certain properties. To recognize
      an apple, in many circumstances, it might suffice to look for
      something that is red AND round AND apple-sized. In order to do
      that, we need a kind of agent that detects when all three conditions
      occur at once. The simplest form of this would be an agent that
      becomes active whenever all three of its inputs are active.</p>

      We can use AND-agents to do many kinds of recognition, but the idea
      also has serious limitations. If you tried to recognize a chair that
      way, you would usually fail, if you insisted on finding <em>four
	legs AND a seat AND a back.</em> You scarcely ever see four legs of
      a chair at the same time, since at least one leg is usually out of
      view. Besides, if someone&#39;s sitting in the chair, you often
      cannot see the seat at all. In real life, no recognition-scheme will
      always work if it&#39;s based on absolutely perfect evidence. A more
      judicious scheme would not demand that every feature of a chair be
      seen; instead, it would only <em>weigh the evidence</em> that a
      chair is present. For example, we could make a chair-agent that
      becomes active whenever five or more of our six chair features are
      in sight:</p>

    <p>
      This scheme, too, will make mistakes. It will miss the chair if too
      many features are out of sight. It will mistake other objects for
      chairs if those features are present but in the wrong arrangement
      &mdash; for example, if all four legs are attached to the same side
      of a <em>seat.</em>  Indeed, it usually won&#39;t suffice merely to
      verify that all the required parts are there &mdash; one also has to
      verify their dimensions and relationships; otherwise our recognizer
      would not distinguish a chair from a couch or even from a bunch of
      boards and sticks. Failure to verify relationships is the basis of a
      certain type of nonsense joke:</p>
