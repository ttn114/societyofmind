<h2>21.7 generalizing with pronomes</h2>

    <p>
      From every moment to the next, a person&#39;s state of mind is
      involved with various objects, topics, goals, and scripts. When you
      hear the words of the sentence, <em>Put the apple in the pail,</em>
      somehow this causes the subjects of <em>apple,</em> <em>pail</em>
      and <em>putting in</em> to <em>occupy your mind.</em> Later
      we&#39;ll speculate about how these become assigned to appropriate
      roles. Here, to make the story short, let&#39;s just assume that at
      a certain point the language-agency interprets the verb <em>put</em>
      to activate a certain Trans-frame and to assign the apple-neme to
      the Object pronome of that Trans-frame. The automatic <em>finding
	machine</em> described earlier then assigns the apple&#39;s location
      to the Origin pronome. Similarly, the pail&#39;s location is
      assigned to the Destination pronome. (As for the Instrument pronome,
      this is assigned to the listener&#39;s hand by default.) Now each
      entity <em>on the listener&#39;s mind</em> is represented by one or
      another pronome assignment. We&#39;re almost done, except that in
      order to actually perform the imagined action, we need some kind of
      control process to activate the proper agencies in the proper
      sequence!</p>

    <p>
      Activate apple-neme, Look-for, and Move.  Then activate Grasp.
      
      Activate pail-neme, Look-for, and Move.  Then activate Ungrasp.</p>

    <p>
      This suggests a way to learn a skill. The first few times you try to
      do something new, you must experiment to find which agents to
      activate, and at what times, and for how long. Later, you can
      prepare a script that will do the job more quickly and easily by
      accumulating memories of which agent-activations were successful,
      together with memories of which polynemes were assigned to various
      pronomes at those moments. For example, if you were to <em>play
	back</em> the
      <em>Trans-script</em> shown above, your arm would find and put a
      second apple in that pail &mdash; without invoking any higher-level
      agencies at all!  However, this script has a dreadful limitation: it
      will work only to put apples into pails. What if you later wished to
      put a block into a box or a spoon into a bowl? We could do that by
      dividing the process into two scripts: a <em>pronome-assignment
	script</em> and an <em>action script.</em></p>

    <p>
      Assignment Script: Assign the apple-neme to the Origin pronome.
      Assign the pail-neme to the Destination pronome.</p>

    <p>
      Action Script: Activate Origin. Then turn on Look-for, Move, and
      Grasp.  Activate Destination. Then turn on Look-for, Move, and
      Ungrasp.</p>

    <p>
      Now notice that the action script never actually mentions the apple
      or pail at all but refers only to the pronomes that represent
      them. Thus the same action script will serve as well for putting a
      block into a box as for putting an apple into a pail!</p>
