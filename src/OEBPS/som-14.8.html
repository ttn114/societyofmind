<h2>14.8 the interaction-square</h2>

    <p>
      What&#39;s so special about moving left or right or up or down? At
      first one might suppose that these ideas work only for motions in a
      two- dimensional space. But we can also use this square-like frame
      for many other realms of thought, to represent how pairs of causes
      interact. What is an interaction, anyway? We say that causes
      interact if, when combined, they lead to effects that neither can
      cause separately. For example, by combining horizontal and vertical
      motions, we can move to places that can&#39;t be reached with either
      kind of motion by itself. We can represent the effects of such
      combinations by using a diagram with labels like those on a compass.</p>

    <p>
      Many of our body joints can move in two independent directions at
      once &mdash; not the knee, but certainly the wrist, shoulder, hip,
      ankle, thumb, and eye. How do we learn to control such complicated
      joints?  My hypothesis is that we do this by training little
      interaction-square agencies, which begin by learning something about
      each of the nine possible motion combinations. I suspect that we
      also base many of our nonphysical skills on interaction-square
      arrays because that is the simplest way to represent what happens
      when two causes interact.  (There is even some evidence that many
      sections of the brain are composed of square arrays of smaller
      agencies. )</p>

    <p>
      Consider that the Spatial agency in our Society-of-More is not
      really involved with space at all, but with interactions between
      agents like Tall and Thin. If you were told that one object A is
      both taller and wider than another object B, you could be sure that
      there is <em>more</em> of A. But if you were told that A is taller
      and thinner than B, you couldn&#39;t be sure which one
      is <em>more.</em> An interaction-square array provides a convenient
      way to represent all the possible combinations:</p>

    <p>
      If square-arrays can represent how pairs of causes interact, could
      similar schemes be used with three or more causes? That might need
      too many <em>directions</em> to be practical. We&#39;d need
      twenty-seven directions to represent three interacting causes this
      way, and eighty-one to represent four. Only rarely, it seems, do
      people deal with more than two causes at a time; instead, we either
      find ways to reformulate such situations or we accumulate disorderly
      societies of partially filled interaction-squares that cover only
      the most commonly encountered combinations.</p>
