<h2>25.4 the sense of continuity</h2>

      

    <p>
      Imagine what these frame-arrays can do! They let
      us <em>visualize</em> imaginary scenes, such as what might happen
      when we move, because the frames for what we can expect to see are
      filled in automatically. Not only that, but by using other processes
      to fill in all those terminals, we can <em>imagine</em> scenes and
      views of things we&#39;ve never seen before. Still, many people find
      it hard to consider the thought that mental images could be based on
      anything as crude as frame-arrays. The world of our experience seems
      so perfectly continuous. Could such smooth thoughts emerge from
      sudden frame-to-frame jumps? If the mind kept jerking from one frame
      to another, wouldn&#39;t what we experience seem equally abrupt? Yet
      we rarely feel our minds change frames, any more than we perceive a
      visual scene as composed of disconnected spots of light. Why do we
      have the sense that things proceed in smooth, continuous ways? Is it
      because, as some mystics think, our minds are part of some flowing
      stream? I think it&#39;s just the opposite: our sense of constant,
      steady change emerges from the parts of mind that manage to insulate
      themselves against the continuous flow of time!</p>

    <p>
      In other words, our sense of smooth progression from one mental
      state to another emerges not from the nature of that progression
      itself, but from the descriptions we use to represent it. Nothing
      can seem jerky except what is represented as jerky. Paradoxically,
      our sense of continuity comes from our marvelous insensitivity to
      most kinds of changes rather than from any genuine perceptiveness.
      Existence seems continuous to us not because we continually
      experience what is happening in the present, but because we hold to
      our memories of how things were in the recent past. Without those
      short-term memories, all would seem entirely new at every instant,
      and we would have no sense at all of continuity or, for that matter,
      of existence.</p>

    <p>
      One might suppose that it would be wonderful to possess a faculty of
      <em>continual awareness.</em> But such an affliction would be worse
      than useless, because the more frequently our higher-level agencies
      change their representations of reality, the harder it is for them
      to find significance in what they sense. The power of consciousness
      comes not from ceaseless change of state, but from having enough
      stability to discern significant changes in our
      surroundings. To <em>notice</em> change requires the ability to
      resist it. In order to sense what persists through time, one must be
      able to examine and compare descriptions from the recent past. We
      notice change in spite of change, not because of it.</p>

    <p>
      Our sense of constant contact with the world is not a genuine
      experience; instead, it is a form of immanence illusion. We have the
      sense of actuality when every question asked of our visual-systems
      is answered so swiftly that it seems as though those answers were
      already there. And that&#39;s what frame-arrays provide us with:
      once any frame fills its terminals, the terminals of the other
      frames in its array are also filled. When every change of view
      engages frames whose terminals are already filled, albeit only by
      default, then sight seems instantaneous.</p>
