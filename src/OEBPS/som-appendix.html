    <h2 class="appendix">heredity and environment</h2>

    <p>
      Sometimes we ask why people are so similar. At other times, we
      wonder why they differ so much from one to the next. Often we try to
      classify our differences into those with which we&#39;re born and
      those we later learn &mdash; and then we find ourselves arguing
      about which virtues are inherited, and which we acquire from
      experience. Most arguments about <em>nature vs. nurture</em> are
      based on two mistakes.  One is to talk about intelligence as though
      a person&#39;s quality of mind were like a quantity one could pour
      into a cup. The other mistake is to assume that there is a clear
      distinction between what we learn and how we learn &mdash; as though
      experience had no effect on how we learn.</p>

    <p>
      Chance plays a major role in human differences, because each of us
      starts out by drawing lots from among our parents&#39; genes. A gene
      is a unit of heredity &mdash; a specific chemical whose structure
      affects some aspects of the construction of the body and the
      brain. We inherit each of our genes from one parent or the other,
      more or less by chance, so as to receive about half of each
      parent&#39;s genes. Within the population as a whole, each
      particular kind of gene has variants that work in somewhat different
      ways, and there are so many possible combinations of these
      alternative genes that every child is born unique &mdash; except in
      the case of identical twins, who carry identical copies of
      genes. One thing that makes people both so different and so similar
      is this: we are similar because those alternative genes are usually
      quite similar &mdash; and we are different because those genes are
      not identical.</p>

    <p>
      Every cell of the body contains identical copies of all of that
      person&#39;s genes. But not all genes are active at the same time
      &mdash; and this is why the cells in our different organs do
      different things. When a particular gene is <em>turned on</em>
      inside a cell, that cell manufactures copies of a particular
      chemical (called a protein), whose structure is determined by the
      structure of that gene. Proteins are used in many ways. Some of them
      are assembled into permanent structures, some are involved in
      manufacturing other chemicals, and certain proteins move around in
      the cell, to serve as messages that alter other processes. Since
      certain combinations of these messages can turn other genes on and
      off, the gene-constructed chemicals in cells can act like small
      societies of agencies.</p>

    <p>
      Every cell has windows in its walls and special genes that control
      which chemicals can enter or leave through those windows. Then,
      certain of those chemicals can act as messages that change the
      states of specific genes in other cells. Thus groups of cells can
      also be societies. The effects of most of those messages between
      cells are temporary and reversible, but some of them can permanently
      change the character of other cells by altering the types of
      messages they can transmit and receive. In effect, this converts
      them into other <em>types</em> of cells. When new types of cells are
      produced this way, certain of them remain in place, but other types
      proceed to move and reproduce &mdash; to form new layers, strands,
      or clumps.  Inside the brain, certain types of cells emit specific
      chemicals that drift out like scents; this causes certain other
      types of mobile cells that are sensitive to those particular
      chemicals to sniff out those scents and track them back to their
      sources &mdash; leaving tubelike trails behind. These traces of the
      travels of those migratory cells then form the nerve-bundles that
      interconnect various pairs of far-apart brain-agencies. With all
      this activity, the embryonic brain resembles a complex animal
      ecology &mdash; which even includes predators programmed to find and
      kill the many cells that happen to reach
      <em>wrong</em> destinations.</p>

    <p>
      All human brains are similar in size and shape but differ in many
      smaller respects because of different alternative genes. Why does
      the human population support so many variant genes? One reason is
      that genes are sometimes altered by accidents. When this happens to
      a gene that lies within a reproductive cell &mdash; that is, inside
      an ovum or a sperm &mdash; the change will be inherited. We call
      this a
      <em>mutation.</em> Most often, a mutant gene will simply fail to
      manufacture some vital chemical, and this will so badly impair the
      offspring that natural selection will quickly remove the mutated
      gene from the population. But occasionally a mutant gene will endow
      those offspring with some substantial advantage. Then natural
      selection will spread copies of that gene so widely among the
      population that its predecessor gene becomes extinct. Finally, a
      variant gene may provide an advantage only in certain circumstances;
      this type of mutation may spread only to a certain proportion of the
      population, and both the new and the old variants will continue to
      coexist indefinitely. The richness of this reservoir of alternative
      genes can determine how quickly a population adapts to changes in
      ecological conditions &mdash; and thus determines whether the entire
      species can escape extinction over longer periods of time.</p>

    <p>
      Now let&#39;s return to what genes do. Not all genes turn on at
      once; some start early and some start late. In general, the sooner a
      gene starts working, the greater its effect on what comes afterward.
      Accordingly, it is the early-starting genes that most affect the
      basic, large-scale architecture of our bodies and our brains. A
      mutation in an early-working gene is likely to cause such a drastic
      alteration of an animal&#39;s basic architecture that the embryo
      will not survive to be born, grow up, and reproduce
      successfully. Accordingly, most mutations of early-working genes are
      swiftly weeded out of the population by natural selection. Mutations
      in later-starting genes tend to cause less drastic differences,
      hence are not so swiftly weeded out and can accumulate in the
      population &mdash; for example, as variations in the genes that
      affect the sizes of connections between various
      brain-agencies. Every different combination of such variant genes
      produces a person with a somewhat different brain.</p>

    <p>
      The early-starting genes thus frame the large-scale outlines of the
      brain &mdash; and their uniformity explains why people are so
      similar on the broadest scale. These must be the genes responsible
      for what we call <em>human nature</em> &mdash; that is, the
      predispositions every normal person shares. Generally, the
      uniformity of early-starting genes is what makes all the members of
      each animal species seem so similar; indeed, it is partly why the
      earth is populated with distinct, recognizable species like lions,
      turtles, and people, rather than with an indistinct continuum of all
      conceivable animals. No human mother ever bears a cat, since that
      would require too many different early-starting genes.</p>

<h2 class="appendix">the genesis of mental realms</h2>

    <p>
      All normal children come to recognize the same sorts of physical
      objects. Is that because the concept of an object is innate in the
      human mind? Each of us becomes attached to certain other
      individuals. Does this mean that the concept of person, and the
      notion of love, are part of our inheritance? Every human child
      forms <em>realms of thought</em> that represent the physical,
      possessional, and psychological. But how could genes build concepts
      into minds when genes themselves are merely linked-together
      chemicals?</p>

    <p>
      The problem is that thoughts proceed on levels so far removed from
      those of chemicals. This makes it hard for genes, which are merely
      chemicals, to represent such things as objects, persons, or ideas
      &mdash; at least in anything like the way that strings of words
      express our thoughts. Then how do genes encode ideas? The answer
      lies in the concept of <em>predestined learning</em> discussed in
      section 11.7. Although groups of genes cannot directly encode
      specific ideas, they can determine the architecture of agencies that
      are destined to learn particular kinds of processes. To illustrate
      this principle, we&#39;ll outline the architecture of an agency
      destined to learn to recognize a human individual.</p>

    <p>
      When we first introduced the concept of a recognizer, we suggested a
      simple way to represent a physical object in terms of properties
      like color, texture, size, and shape &mdash; by combining evidence
      from several agencies, each containing sensors especially designed
      to react to certain particular properties. Now we&#39;ll take
      another step, by dividing each of those agencies into two sections
      that are similar in architecture, and which both receive sensory
      inputs from the eyes, ears, skin, and nose. The first system is
      destined, as before, to learn to represent physical objects in terms
      of simple properties. However, because the second system&#39;s
      inputs come from different types of agents, it is destined to learn
      to represent <em>social objects</em> &mdash; that is, people.</p>

    <img class="illus" src="./illus/appendix/Appendix-1.png"/>


    <p>
      Our second <em>social object</em> agency takes all of its inputs
      from sensors that detect stimuli which usually signify the presence
      of a person &mdash; namely, human odors, voices, and faces. Because
      of this &mdash; and even though the genes that assemble this system
      know nothing of people &mdash; this system has no alternative but to
      learn to represent relations among the features of human
      individuals.  Accordingly, this agency is destined to learn to
      recognize people!</p>

    <p>
      The large-scale outline of this agency poses no engineering mystery
      &mdash; but we have to ask how genes could produce the sensory
      detectors that the system needs to do its job. There is ample
      evidence that the recognition of both voices and faces does indeed
      take place in special sections of the brain &mdash; since certain
      injuries of the brain leave their victims unable to distinguish
      voice sounds yet still able to recognize many other kinds of sounds,
      while other brain injuries destroy the ability to recognize faces
      but leave other visual functions intact. No one yet knows just how
      these recognition-systems work, but let&#39;s consider each in turn.</p>

    <p>
      ODOR RECOGNITION: It is easy to build recognizers for particular
      odors because an odor is merely the presence of a certain
      combination of chemicals in the air, and a specific gene can make a
      cell sensitive to a particular chemical. So, to build agents for
      recognizing the odors of particular objects or people requires
      little more than connecting a variety of evidence-weighing</p>

    <p>
      agents to a variety of specific chemical detectors.
      
      VOICE RECOGNITION: To distinguish the sounds of a human voice
      requires more machinery because vocal expressions are complicated
      sequences of events. Machines have been built that can make such
      distinctions.
      
      FACE RECOGNITION: No one has yet been able to build vision machines
      that approach our human ability to distinguish faces from other
      objects &mdash; or even to distinguish dogs from cats. This remains
      a problem for research.</p>

    <p>
      In their first few days, human infants learn to distinguish people
      by their odors; then, over the next few weeks, they learn to
      recognize individuals by sound of voice; only after several months
      do they start to reliably distinguish the sights of faces. Most
      likely we learn to make each of these distinctions by several
      different methods, and it is probably no accident that these
      abilities develop in a sequence that corresponds to their increasing
      complexity.</p>

      <h2 class="appendix">gestures and trajectories</h2>

    <p>
      To recognize a voice or face seems hard enough; how does a child
      learn to recognize another person&#39;s mental state &mdash; of
      being angry or affectionate, for example. One way is by
      distinguishing trajectories.  Just as we learn to interpret certain
      types of changes as representing the motions of objects in the
      physical realm, we learn to classify other types of changes as
      signifying mental events; these are what we call
      <em>gestures</em> and <em>expressions.</em> For example, to identify
      a certain sound to be a particular language-word, some agencies
      inside your brain must recognize that a certain sequence of phonetic
      features has occurred. At the same time, other agencies interpret
      sequences of vocal sounds as having significance in other realms. In
      particular, certain types of vocal sounds are recognized as
      signifying specific emotional qualities. For example, people almost
      universally agree on which expressions seem most angry or
      imperative. In general, abruptly changing sounds evoke alarm &mdash;
      perhaps by inducing the sort of narrowing of interest that comes
      with pain; in any case, sudden changes in volume and pitch demand
      that we attend to them. In contrast, we react to <em>gentle</em>
      sounds in ways that people label
      <em>positive,</em> as with affection, love, or reverence; the
      smoother time-trajectories do somehow serve to <em>calm us
	down,</em> thus frequently inducing us to set aside our other
      interests. It&#39;s quite the same for sight and touch; hostile
      persons tend to jab and shout, while friendly people speak and wave
      with gestures and trajectories that we perceive as signifying
      gentleness and tenderness. Indeed, as shown in Manfred Clynes&#39;s
      book, Sentics, Doubleday, New York, 1978, people show similar
      emotional responses to certain types of time-trajectories regardless
      of the sensory domain. We consistently identify certain sudden,
      jerky types of action patterns as indicating anger &mdash;
      regardless of whether these are presented as visual motions, as
      envelopes of voice sounds, or as pushing, shoving tactile
      stimuli. In the same way, we consistently identify certain other,
      smoother action patterns to indicate affection. Clynes concludes
      that at least half a dozen distinct types of trajectories are
      universally associated with particular emotional states. What sort
      of brain-machinery could cause us to react in such similar ways to
      such different kinds of stimuli? I propose a three-part
      hypothesis. First, each of our sensory-agencies is equipped with
      special agents that detect certain types of
      time-trajectories. Second, the outputs of all the agents that detect
      similar <em>trajectory types</em> in different agencies are
      connected, through special connection bundles, to converge upon
      agents in some central <em>gesture-recognizing</em> agency. Finally,
      genetically established nerve-bundles run from each
      gesture-recognizing agent to a particular
      infantile <em>proto-specialist</em> of the sort described in section
      16. 3.</p>

    <p>
      According to this hypothesis, each sensory-agency contains agents
      that are specialized to react to various types of temporal
      trajectories.  For example, one kind might react only to stimuli
      that increase slowly and then decrease quickly; another kind might
      react only to signals that increase quickly and decay slowly. Inside
      the brain, although the agencies for hearing, sight, and touch lie
      far apart, the signals from agents that detect similar trajectories
      converge on a common agency composed of evidence-weighing agents.</p>

    <img class="illus" src="./illus/appendix/Appendix-2.png" />


    <p>
      Notice that the architecture of this system is so similar to that of
      our
      <em>person-recognizing</em> agency that the two systems could form
      parallel layers; however, the destiny of each
      central <em>trajectory-type</em> agent is to learn to recognize, not
      a particular person, but a particular type of gesture or
      expression. For example, one such agent might learn to react in
      similar ways to a snarl, grimace, or shaken fist &mdash; and thus
      become an <em>anger-recognizing</em> agent whose function
      is <em>abstract</em> in the sense of being detached from any
      particular class of sensations.</p>

    <p>
      To be sure, recognizing anger is not the same as comprehending or
      sympathizing with anger &mdash; nor does merely learning to make
      such a recognition, by itself, teach us to identify
      an <em>anger-type</em> trajectory of another person with our own
      personal experience of being angry.  But if our genes equip us with
      connections from particular central trajectory-type agents to
      specific <em>proto-specialist</em> agencies, then each particular
      trajectory-type recognition would tend to activate a specific kind
      of emotional reaction.</p>

    <p>
      Some of these connections could endow us with certain
      <em>empathies</em> &mdash; for example, to feel elated upon
      recognizing another person&#39;s joyous gestures. Other connections
      could make us become defensive at signs of aggression &mdash; or
      even aggressive at signs of weakness and withdrawal. There are
      innumerable examples, in animal behavior, of particular types of
      gestures evoking <em>instinctive</em> types of reactions, as when a
      sudden motion toward a bird provokes a fear-reaction flight. Surely
      our human genes provide us with a great deal of instinctive
      wiring. However, far more than any other kind of animal, we also
      have machinery that can bridge new agencies across the older ones,
      so that we can learn to bury ancient instincts under modern social
      disciplines.</p>

    <p>
      We&#39;ve seen how a gene-built agency could predispose us to use
      trajectory types to represent emotional and other sorts of states of
      mind. Once this is done, higher-level agencies could use the signals
      from trajectory-type agents to learn to recognize and represent more
      complex successions of mental states. In time, those representations
      could be assembled into models we could use for predicting and
      controlling our own mental processes. This illustrates how
      architectures framed by genes could serve our minds as stepping-
      stones toward learning how to think about ourselves.</p>

    <p>
      As soon as you enter a certain room, you may experience the feeling
      that you can directly sense its history. Many people attribute such
      perceptions to imaginary influences with names
      like <em>intuitions,</em>
      <em>spirits,</em> <em>atmospheres,</em> and <em>vibrations.</em> Yet
      very likely all such perceptions come from inside the mind of those
      observers, as various mental agencies accomplish clever syntheses
      from clues derived from features and trajectories. In my view,
      believing in vibrations and ghosts diminishes our capabilities for
      mental growth by diverting attention from the mind and attributing
      those abilities to imaginary entities outside ourselves.</p>

<h2 class="appendix">brain connections</h2>

    <p>
      What possible sort of brain-machine could support a billion-agent
      society of mind? The human brain contains so many agencies and
      connections that it resembles a great nation of cities and towns,
      linked by vast networks of roads and highways. We are born with
      brain centers that are specialized for every sense and muscle group:
      for moving every eye and limb; for distinguishing the sounds of
      words, the features of faces, and all sorts of touches, tastes and
      smells. We&#39;re born with protospecialists involved with hunger,
      laughter, fear and anger, sleep, and sexual activity &mdash; and
      surely many other functions no one has discovered yet &mdash; each
      based upon a somewhat different architecture and mode of
      operation. Thousands of different genes must be involved in laying
      out these agencies and the nerve-bundles between them &mdash; and
      those brain-growth genes must generate at least three kinds of
      processes. Those genetic systems first must form the clumps and
      layers of brain cells that eventually become groups of agents; they
      must dictate the inner workings of those agencies; and, finally,
      they must determine the sizes and destinations of the nerve-bundles
      that interconnect those agencies &mdash; in order to
      constrain <em>who talks to whom</em> within each mind-society.</p>

    <p>
      Now every population will include some variants among the genes that
      shape those highways in the brain, and this must influence their
      bearers&#39; potential styles of thought. A person born with
      unusually sparse connections between the agencies for sight and
      speech might develop powerful machinery in both those realms but
      find it hard to make direct connections between them. On the
      surface, that might seem to constitute a disability. However, it
      might also lead to an advantage &mdash; if it served to force
      one&#39;s higher-level agencies to seek out indirect connections
      that lead to more articulate ways to represent reality. Similarly,
      one might suppose there would be advantages in having an uncommonly
      large capacity for short-term memory. Yet for all we know, our
      evolution has disfavored that because it tends to lead to less
      effective use of hard-learned long-term memories. Other differences
      in how we think could stem from variations in connection paths. An
      individual whose K-lines had more branches than usual might become
      inclined to assemble larger-than-usual accumulations in cases where
      a person whose memory-agents had fewer branches might be more
      disposed toward building uniframes. But the same genetic disposition
      can lead to different styles of thought: one person who is
      genetically disposed toward making uniframes might succumb to the
      chronic use of superficial stereotypes, while another person
      similarly endowed might compensate by building more deeply layered
      agencies that lead to more profound ideas. Although each particular
      variation will dispose each individual toward certain traits of
      personality, the final effect of any gene depends upon how it
      interacts with the structures built by other genes &mdash; and upon
      countless other accidents.  This makes it almost meaningless to ask
      which particular genes lead to <em>good</em> forms of thought. It is
      better to think of a developing brain as a forest within which many
      different creatures grow, in conflict and in harmony.</p>

    <p>
      Let&#39;s return to the architecture of machines that could hold
      societies of mind. How complicated this must be depends in part upon
      how many agents must be active at each moment. We can clarify the
      problem by considering two extremes. If only a few agents need to
      work at any time, then even an ordinary, serial, one-step-at-a-time
      computer could support billions of such agents &mdash; because each
      agent could be represented by a separate computer program. Then the
      computer itself could be quite simple, provided it has access to
      enough memory to hold all those little programs. On the other hand,
      no such arrangement would suffice to simulate societies of mind in
      which each of billions of agents constantly interact with all the
      others, all at once, because that would need more wires than any
      animal could carry in its head. I suspect that the human brain works
      somewhere in between; we do indeed have billions of nerve cells
      working at the same time, but relatively few of them have any need
      to communicate with more than a small proportion of the rest; this
      is simply because most agents are too specialized to deal with many
      types of messages. Accordingly, we&#39;ll propose an architecture
      that lies between those serial and parallel extremes &mdash; namely,
      a compromise in which a typical agent has comparatively few direct
      connections to other agents but can still influence a great many
      other agents through several indirect steps. For example, we can
      imagine a society in which each of a billion agents is connected to
      thirty other agents, selected at random. Then most pairs of agents
      should be able to communicate through merely half a dozen
      intermediates! This is because a typical agent can reach thirty
      others in one step, a thousand others in two steps, and a million
      others in only four steps. Thus a typical agent could reach any of
      the other billion agents in only six or seven steps!</p>

    <p>
      However, randomly selected connections would not be very useful,
      because very few randomly selected pairs of agents would have any
      messages that might be useful to one another. When we actually
      examine the human brain, we find that connections between cells are
      not made either uniformly or randomly. Instead, within any typical
      small region, we see a great many direct connections between nearby
      cells but only a relatively small number of bundles of connections
      to other regions of cells that lie farther away. Here is an
      idealized representation of this arrangement:</p>

    <img class="illus" src="./illus/appendix/Appendix-3.png" />


    <p>
      An embryonic brain might assemble such a structure by repeating a
      sequence of cell divisions and migrations perhaps half a dozen
      times.  If only that were done, the resulting structure would be
      uselessly repetitive. However, in a real brain&#39;s growth, this
      underlying building plan is modified at every step by many other
      processes, and this produces many agencies that are similar in
      general form but different in specific details. Some of these
      gene-controlled interventions modify the properties of specific
      layers and clumps of cells, and this determines the internal
      workings of particular agencies. Other interventions affect the
      sizes and destinations of the nerve-bundles that interconnect
      particular pairs of agencies. Such highway-routing processes could
      be used, for example, to lead the nerves that emerge from the
      trajectory-type sensors in different agencies to the same central
      destination. This would be quite easy to arrange because the
      trajectory agents of similar types would tend to have similar
      genetic origins &mdash; and that would predispose them to be able
      to <em>smell</em> the same varieties of embryonic message chemicals
      and thus grow toward the same destination.</p>

    <p>
      The same genetic argument can be applied to other aspects of a
      child&#39;s development &mdash; for example, to why all children
      seem to grow such similar Societies-of-More. When we discussed Jean
      Piaget&#39;s experiments, we left it as a mystery how children form
      the agencies called History and Appearance. What leads all those
      different minds to similar conceptions of comparisons? In section
      10.7 we hinted that this might happen because similar agents like
      Tall and Thin originate in related sections of the brain. Consider
      that despite the fact that we do not know the brain-machinery for
      agents like Tall and Thin, we can be virtually sure that they are
      similar internally, because they both respond to the same sorts of
      spatial differences. Therefore, they almost surely have a common
      evolutionary origin and are constructed by the same or similar
      genes. Consequently, the embryonic brain cells that form these
      agents will tend to have similar
      <em>senses of smell</em> and are therefore likely to send out nerves
      that converge upon the same (or similar) agencies. From this point
      of view, the formation of a Spatial agency on which such properties
      converge need not be an unlikely chance event, but could be
      virtually predestined by inheritance.</p>

    <p>
      Papert&#39;s principle requires many agencies to grow by inserting
      new layers of agents into older, already working systems. But this
      poses a problem because, once brain cells reach maturity, they no
      longer have much mobility. Consequently, adding new layers to old
      agencies must involve using brain cells in other locations. As far
      as we know, the only way this could be done is by using connections
      already available in the neighborhood of the original
      agency. Here&#39;s one way embryonic cells could provide frameworks
      for future multilayered mind-societies:</p>

 <img class="illus" src="./illus/appendix/Appendix-4.png" />

    <p>
      Any agency that is potentially capable of expanding to assimilate a
      lifetime of experience would need more space than any clump or layer
      of cells could provide in any compact neighborhood. This must be why
      the cerebral cortex &mdash; the newest and largest portion of the
      brain &mdash; evolved its convoluted form.</p>
    <img class="illus" src="./illus/appendix/Appendix-5.png" />

    <p>
      If the connections in the cortex of the brain develop this way,
      through sequences of cell migrations, it could provide each local
      neighborhood with potential access to several other areas, through
      fanlike bundles and arrays of nerves. I have the impression the
      human cortex becomes thus folded upon itself perhaps five or six
      times, so that agents in each neighborhood have potential access to
      several other levels of convolution. This makes it possible for a
      typical agent to become connected to millions of other agents
      through only a few indirect connections. Presumably, only a small
      minority of cells ever actually acquire many such connections for
      their own exclusive use; however, such an arrangement makes any
      particular group of cells potentially capable of acquiring more
      significance &mdash; for example, by gaining control of a
      substantial bundle of connections that comes to represent some
      useful microneme. In its evolutionary course of making available so
      many potential connections, the human brain has actually gone so far
      that the major portion of its substance is no longer in its agencies
      but constitutes the enormous bundles of nerve fibers that
      potentially connect those agencies. The brain of Homo sapiens is
      mainly composed of cabling.</p>

<h2 class="appendix">survival instinct</h2>

    <p>
      Many people seem to think that living things are born endowed with
      built-in instincts to survive. And certainly all animals do many
      things to stay alive. They build defenses against threats; they
      reproduce at any cost; they shy away from extremes of cold or heat,
      and from unfamiliarity. Now it usually is sensible, when one sees
      similarities, to seek some common cause for them. But I&#39;ll argue
      that it&#39;s usually wrong to seek a common force. There are many
      different reasons why animals do many things that help keep them
      alive &mdash; and, as we&#39;ll see, there is even a reason why
      there are so many different reasons. But to attribute this to any
      single, central force or to some basic, underlying survival instinct
      is as foolish as believing in special powers that attract corpses to
      cemeteries or broken cars to scrapyards.</p>

    <p>
      No animal requires any central reason to survive, nor does the
      process of evolution itself require any reason to produce all those
      survival aids. On the contrary, evolution&#39;s versatility stems
      from its very lack of any fixed direction or constraint that might
      restrict its possibilities.</p>

    <p>
      To understand why animals survive, one must see evolution as a sieve
      &mdash; that only passes through its mesh those animals who leave
      more offspring than the rest.</p>

    <p>
      Many people also think that evolution favors life &mdash; although
      it is a painful fact that most mutated animals must die before they
      reproduce. But hindsight makes us tend to count only the survivors
      we see, while overlooking all the misfits that have disappeared; it
      is the same mistake that one might make from looking only at the sky
      &mdash; to then conclude that all the animals were birds. The
      animals we see today are precisely those whose ancestors accumulated
      a great many survival aids &mdash; and that is why so much of their
      behavior seems directed toward promoting their welfare &mdash; if
      only in the surroundings in which their ancestors evolved. It is an
      illusion that all those accumulated mechanisms have anything in
      common; actually, that seeming uniformity has no coherence of its
      own: it is nothing but the shadow of that evolutionary sieve. The
      myth of an underlying survival instinct explains nothing that cannot
      better be explained without it, and blinds us to the fact that each
      of those survival aids may exploit an entirely different mechanism.</p>

    <p>
      I certainly don&#39;t mean to deny that people learn to love life
      and to fear death. But this is no simple matter of obeying some
      elemental instinct.  It involves the development over many years of
      elaborate societies of concepts. Nor do I mean to say that people
      are born without any instincts at all and must learn everything from
      experience. On the contrary, we start with many built-in fragments
      of machinery, and these predestine us to learn to shy away from
      diverse forms of pain, discomfort, insecurity, and other forms of
      bodily and mental harm.  But compared to those instinctive fears,
      the state of nonexistence we call death is a far more strange and
      difficult idea, of which no infant can conceive.</p>

<h2 class="appendix">evolution and intent</h2>

    <p>
      Could animals have evolved as they did, if <em>nature</em> had no
      sense of goal? A century ago, the world of biologists split in two
      on one side stood the <em>evolutionists,</em> who held that animals
      evolve through nothing more than accidents of chance. Their
      antagonists were called the <em>teleologists</em>; they disbelieved
      that such excellent animals could evolve without any purposeful
      guidance. The evolutionists turned out to be right, for now we can
      watch small animals and plants evolve before our very eyes and, at a
      correspondingly slower pace, see similar developments in creatures
      that have longer lives. In fact, we can actually observe how random
      accidents to genes lead to the selective survival of particular
      individuals in various environments &mdash; without the faintest
      reason to suspect that any goals must be involved. So why do so many
      people feel that evolution must have purposes? I suspect that this
      belief is based on combining a sound insight about problem solving
      with an unsound image of how evolution works. For example, common
      sense tells us that a person might never hit upon a design for a
      flying machine entirely by trial and error, without having any goals
      or purposes. This leads one to suppose that nature, too, must be
      subject to that same constraint. The error comes from thinking
      of <em>nature</em> as being concerned with such problems as finding
      a way to make animals fly.</p>

    <p>
      The trouble is that this confuses uses with purposes. For example,
      suppose one asked how birds evolved, while thoughtlessly assuming
      that feathers and wings evolved exclusively for use in flight. One
      would be confronted with a formidable problem, since any organ as
      complex as a wing would require too many different genes to ever
      appear by random chance.</p>

    <p>
      So long as one&#39;s mind is fixed on flight, one might feel that
      the only solution is to find some flight advantage in each and every
      earlier stage that merely produced a protofeather or protowing too
      small and weak for actual flight. This is why so many
      antievolutionists demand that evolutionary advocates must fill in
      every imagined
      <em>gap</em> along a direct path toward a specified goal. However,
      once we abandon that fixed idea, it is easier to see how various
      intermediate developments could have provided those animals with
      advantages quite unrelated to flying. For example, the early
      ancestors of birds could have accumulated genes to manufacture
      various sorts of feathered appendages that helped to wrap those
      protobirds in body cloaks that kept them warm. This sort of
      fortuitous <em>preparation</em> unrelated to any goal of flight
      would have made it much more likely that other accidents, perhaps
      millions of years later, might have brought a few such elements
      together to lend some genuine aerial advantage to an animal already
      prone to making leaps.</p>

    <p>
      Incidentally, I do not mean to say that evolutionary processes must
      by their nature be devoid of purposes. We can actually conceive of
      how machinery could exist inside an animal, to purposefully direct
      some aspects of its evolution in much the way a farmer can promote
      the evolution of chickens that bear more meat or sheep that grow
      more wool. Indeed, the reproductive machinery inside our cells has
      already evolved so as to produce variations that are more likely to
      be useful than would otherwise occur by purely random chance; this
      idea is explained in a brilliant essay by Douglas Lenat,
      entitled <em>The role of Heuristics in learning by Discovery,</em>
      in Machine Learning: An Artificial Intelligence Approach, edited by
      R. Z. Michalski, J. J.  Carbonell, and T. M. Mitchell; Tioga
      Publishing Co., Palo Alto, Calif., 1983. It is even conceivable that
      our genetic systems might even contain some forms of
      difference-engine-like machinery that, over very long periods of
      time, generate variations in a somewhat purposeful manner. To be
      sure, this is mere speculation, since no such system has yet been
      discovered.</p>

    <p>
      In any case, one aftermath of the controversy with teleologists was
      that many scientists in other realms became so afraid of making
      similar mistakes that the very concept of purpose became taboo
      throughout science. Even today, most scientists regard it as an
      abomination to use <em>anthropomorphic</em> or <em>intentional</em>
      language in connection with anything but persons or higher
      animals. This burdened the science of psychology with a
      double-barreled handicap.  On one side, it made psychologists regard
      many of their most important problems as outside the scope of
      scientific explanation. On the other side, it deprived them of many
      useful technical ideas &mdash; because such concept-words
      as <em>want,</em> <em>expect,</em> and <em>recognize</em> are among
      the most effective ever found for describing what happens in human
      minds. It was not until the <em>cybernetic revolution</em> of the
      1940s that scientists finally realized there is nothing inherently
      unscientific about the concept of goal itself and that attributing
      goals to evolution was bad not because it was impossible, but simply
      because it was wrong. Human minds do indeed use goal-machinery, and
      there is nothing wrong with recognizing this and bringing technical
      theories about intentions and goals into psychology.</p>

    <h2 class="appendix">insulation and interaction</h2>
    <p>
      <blockquote>
	The hardest thing to understand is why we can understand&nbsp;
	anything at all.
	<cite>&mdash;Albert Einstein</cite></blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      What hope is there for any human mind to understand a human
      brain? No one could ever memorize the whole of all its small
      details.  Our only hope is in formulating their principles. It
      wouldn&#39;t be much use, in any case, to know how each separate
      part works and how it interacts with the rest &mdash; because
      that simply isn&#39;t practical. Even if you knew all those
      details, if someone asked you to describe &mdash; in general
      terms &mdash; how brains work and how they change, you would
      have no way to reply.</p>

    <p>
      We usually like to think in positive terms about how various parts
      of systems interact. But to do that, we must first have good ideas
      about which aspects of a system do not interact &mdash; since
      otherwise there would be too many possibilities to consider. In
      other words, we have to understand insulations before we can
      comprehend interactions. To put this in a stronger form: No
      complicated society would actually work if it really depended on
      interactions among most of its parts. This is because any such
      system would be disabled by virtually any distortion, injury, or
      environmental fluctuation. Nor could any such society evolve in the
      first place.</p>

    <p>
      The science of biology was itself shaped by the discovery of
      insulations. Plants and animals were scarcely understood at all
      until it was found that they were made of separate cells. Then
      little more was learned so long as scientists thought of cells as
      bags of fluid within which countless chemicals could freely
      interact. Today we know that cells are more like factories,
      containing systems that are kept apart by sturdy walls, with doors
      that open only to those substances that bear the proper
      keys. Furthermore, even within these compartments, most pairs of
      chemicals cannot interact except by permission of particular
      genes. Without those insulations, so many chemicals would interact
      that all our cells would die.</p>

    <p>
      For the purposes of this book, I have emphasized highly insulated
      systems &mdash; that is, mechanisms in which different functions are
      embodied in different agents. However, it is important to put this
      in perspective. For example, in chapter 19, we drew a sharp
      distinction between memorizers and recognizers; this made it easy to
      explain those ideas. However, in section 20.9 we mentioned very
      briefly the idea of a <em>distributed memory,</em> in which both
      those functions are combined in the same network of agents. Now I do
      not want the reader to take the brevity of that discussion to
      suggest the subject is not important. On the contrary, I suspect
      that most of the human brain is actually composed of distributed
      learning-systems and that it is extremely important for us to
      understand how they can work. It is possible to combine even more
      functions; for example, John Hopfield has demonstrated a single
      distributed network that not only combines memory and recognition,
      but also <em>correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of
	sufficient size</em> &mdash; in other words, an agency
      that <em>closes the ring,</em> much as described in section 19.10.
      See Hopfield&#39;s article in the Proceedings of the National
      Academy of Science, 79, p. 2554, 1982, or the book Parallel
      Distributed Processing by D. E. Rumelhart and J. L. McLelland,
      M.I.T. Press, 1986.</p>

    <p>
      The advantages of distributed systems are not alternatives to the
      advantages of insulated systems; the two are complementary. To say
      that the brain may be composed of distributed systems is not the
      same as saying that it is a distributed system &mdash; that is, a
      single network in which all functions are uniformly distributed. I
      do not believe any brain of that sort could work, because the
      interactions would be uncontrollable. To be sure, we have to explain
      how different ideas can become connected to one another &mdash; but
      we must also explain what keeps our separate memories intact. For
      example, we have praised the power of metaphors that allow us to
      combine ideas from different realms &mdash; but all that power would
      be lost if all our metaphors got mixed! Similarly, the architecture
      of a mind-society must encourage the formation and maintenance of
      distinct levels of management by preventing the formation of
      connections between agencies whose messages have no mutual
      significance. Some theorists have assumed that distributed systems
      are inherently both robust and versatile, but actually those
      attributes are likely to conflict. Systems with too many
      interactions of different types will tend to be fragile, while
      systems with too many interactions of similar types will be too
      redundant to adapt to novel situations and requirements. Finally,
      distributed systems tend to lack explicit, articulated
      representations, and this makes it difficult for any such agency to
      discover how any other such agency works.  Thus, if distributed
      memory-systems are widely used within our brains, as I suspect they
      are, that could be yet another reason for the shallowness of human
      consciousness.</p>

<h2 class="appendix">evolution of human thought</h2>

    <p>
      What are the origins of human thought? Today, we&#39;re almost sure
      that our closest living relatives branched out according to the
      diagram below. It shows that none of the species that still exist
      are directly descended from any of the others, but that they all
      share common ancestors, now long extinct.</p>

    <img class="illus" src="./illus/appendix/Appendix-6.png" />


    <p>
      How different are we human beings from all the other animals? We
      recognize how similar those various brains and bodies are. But in
      view of our exceptional abilities to speak and think, we certainly
      seem to be unique. Could chimpanzees or gorillas ever learn to speak
      the way we do? Experience has shown that these wonderful animals can
      indeed learn to make connections among hundreds of different words
      and ideas, enabling them to produce speechlike strings of symbol-
      signs for expressing Trans-actions such as <em>Put the candy into
	the box.</em> However, the same experiments appear to show that
      these animals find it much more difficult to construct
      language-strings in which the terminals of certain frames are filled
      with other filled-in frames. In other words, no one has succeeded in
      teaching these animals to use expressions that involve interruption
      clauses, such as
      <em>Put the candy that is in the pail into the box.</em> To be sure,
      our inability to teach such things does not prove that these animals
      are inherently incapable of them. Still, no one can doubt that we
      have capabilities our ancestors did not possess. What sorts of brain
      developments could have given rise to our new and mighty forms of
      thought? Here are some possible candidates:</p>

    <p>
      The capacity to attach new K-lines to old ones enabled us to build
      hierarchical memory-trees.
      
      The availability of more versatile temporary memories enabled us to
      pursue subgoals and to tolerate more complicated kinds of
      interruptions.
      
      The evolution of paranomes &mdash; that is, of isonomes that bridge
      across multiple realms &mdash; enabled us to examine the same
      problem from several viewpoints.</p>

    <p>
      The emergence of additional layers of agents allowed each child to
      grow through more stages of development.</p>

    <p>
      None of those advances by itself would seem to pose any special
      evolutionary difficulty. But what could have caused so many changes
      to have appeared so rapidly? Our ancestors diverged from their
      relatives, the gorillas and the chimpanzees, only a few million
      years ago, and our human brains have grown substantially in only the
      last few hundred thousand years. Little is known of what happened in
      that interval because we have found very few fossil remains of our
      ancestors. (This could be partly because their population was never
      very large but could also be because they had become too smart to
      permit themselves to be fossilized.) The evolutionary interval was
      so brief that most of our genes and brain structures remain nearly
      the same as those of the chimpanzees. Was it merely an increase in
      the brain&#39;s size and capacity that produced our new abilities?
      Consider that, by itself, an increase in the size of the brain might
      only cause the disadvantage of mental confusion and the
      inconvenience of a heavier head. However, if we first evolved
      significant advances in the ability to manage our memories, we could
      then take advantage of more memory. Similarly, inserting new layers
      of agents into old agencies might only lead to bad results &mdash;
      unless this were preceded by mechanisms for using such layers
      as <em>middle- level managers</em> without disrupting older
      functions. In other words, our evolution must have worked the other
      way: first came enhancements in abilities that made it feasible for
      us to manage larger agencies. Then, once we had the capability for
      using more machinery, natural selection could favor those who grew
      more massive brains.</p>
