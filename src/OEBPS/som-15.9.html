<h2>15.9 interruption and recovery</h2>

    <p>
      Imagine that you plan to take a trip. You start to think of how
      you&#39;ll pack your traveling case and start some spatial
      problem-solving agency &mdash; call it Packer &mdash; to see how to
      fit the larger items in. Then you interrupt yourself to think about
      your smaller things, perhaps of how to pack your jewelry in a
      smaller box. Now Packer has to reapply itself to a new and different
      box-packing problem. The problem of keeping track of what is
      happening is hard enough when one agency calls on another one for
      help. Until the other&#39;s job is done, the first agency has to
      keep some temporary record of what it was doing. In Packer&#39;s
      case the problem is even worse because it interrupts itself to pack
      the smaller box. And here is the important point: when that second
      packing job is done and we return to the first, we mustn&#39;t go
      all the way back to the very beginning, or else we would be caught
      in a circular loop. Instead, we must return to the point where we
      were when we interrupted ourselves &mdash; which means the system
      needs some memory to keep track of what it was doing before. This is
      exactly the same problem we mentioned long ago when Find and See had
      several different jobs to do at the same time.</p>

    <p>
      Why do we so often get confused when we&#39;re interrupted? Because
      then we have to keep our place in several processes at once. To keep
      things straight, our memory-control machinery needs intricate
      skills.  Yet psychologically, we&#39;re unaware that ordinary
      thinking is so complicated. If someone asked, <em>What was your mind
	just doing?</em> you might say something like this:</p>

    <p>
      <em>I was thinking about packing that suitcase, and started to
	wonder if the umbrella might fit. I remembered that on an earlier
	trip, I managed to fit my camera tripod in the same case, and I
	tried to compare the umbrella and the tripod in my mind, to see
	which one was longer.</em></p>

    <p>
      Now, this might be a true account of some of the things you were
      thinking about. But it says little of how the mental work was
      actually done. To understand how thinking works, we&#39;d really
      need descriptions of the processes themselves:</p>

    <p>
      <em>A few moments ago, I activated two micromemory-units inside
	Packer, one of my space-arranging agencies, while also activating
	one of Packer&#39;s memory-control scripts. This script proceeded
	to use the information inside those two micromemory-units as cues
	to fetch certain partial states from the long-term memory-system
	attached to Packer. Next, the script controlling Packer&#39;s
	memory-system requested a certain higher-level planning-agency to
	record most of Packer&#39;s present state. Then it interchanged
	the contents of the two active micromemory units, and then used
	other cues to fetch another, second script from long-term memory
	&mdash; and thus erased the present copy of itself. The last step
	of that second script caused yet another micromemory-unit to
	restore Packer to its previous state, so that the original script
	could continue on its interrupted course. Then . . .</em></p>

    <p>
      But no one ever says such things. The processes are too many levels
      away from those we use to work the short-term memories involved with
      language and consciousness. We couldn&#39;t think so if we wanted to
      &mdash; without knowing more about the anatomy of our memory-</p>

    <p>
      machinery. Even if we had ways to represent those processes at
      higher levels, our memory-controls would probably be overloaded by
      attempting, both at the same time, to solve a difficult problem and
      to remember everything that was done while solving it.</p>
