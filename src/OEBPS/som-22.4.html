<h2>22.4 learning and teaching</h2>

    <p>
      One frustration every teacher knows arises when a child learns a
      subject well enough to pass a test, yet never puts that skill to use
      on problems met in <em>real life.</em> It doesn&#39;t often help to
      scold but it sometimes helps to explain, through examples, how to
      apply the concept to other contexts. Why do some children seem to do
      this for themselves, automatically and spontaneously, while others
      seem to have to learn essentially the same thing over and over in
      different domains? Why are some children better than others
      at <em>transfer of learning</em> from one domain to another? It
      doesn&#39;t explain anything to say that those children
      are <em>smarter,</em> <em>brighter,</em> or <em>more
	intelligent.</em> Such vaguely defined capacities vary greatly even
      among different parts of the same mind.</p>

    <p>
      The power of what we learn depends on how we represent it in our
      minds. We&#39;ve seen how the same experience can lead to learning
      different action scripts by replacing certain polynemes with
      isonomes.</p>

    <p>
      Certain of those versions will apply only to specific situations,
      others will apply to many more situations, and yet others will be so
      general and vague as to lead only to confusion. Some children learn
      to represent knowledge in versatile ways; others end up with
      accumulations of inflexible, single-purpose procedures or with
      almost useless generalities. How do children acquire
      their <em>representation skills</em> in the first place? An
      educational environment can lead a child to build large, complicated
      processes from smaller ones by laying out sequences of steps. Good
      teachers know what size to make each step and can often suggest
      analogies to help the child&#39;s mind to use what it already knows
      for building larger scripts and processes. By making each step small
      enough, we can keep the child from getting lost in unfamiliar worlds
      of meaningless alternatives; then the child will remain able to use
      previous skills to test and modify the growing new structures. But
      when a new fragment of knowledge or process constitutes too abrupt a
      break from the past, then none of the child&#39;s old recognizers
      and action scripts will apply to it; the child will get stuck,
      and <em>transfer of learning</em> won&#39;t occur. Why are some
      children better than others at <em>teaching themselves</em> to make
      changes inside their minds?</p>

    <p>
      Each child learns, from time to time, various better ways to learn
      &mdash; but no one understands how this is done. We tend to speak
      about <em>intelligence</em> because we find it virtually impossible
      to understand how this is done from watching only what the child
      does. The problem is that one can&#39;t observe a child&#39;s
      strategies for
      <em>learning how to learn</em> &mdash; because those strategies are
      twice removed from what we can see. It is hard enough to guess the
      character of the A-brain systems that directly cause those actions.
      Think how much more difficult it would be for an observer to imagine
      the multilayer teacher-learner structures that must have worked
      inside the child to train the A-brain agencies! And that observer
      has no way at all to guess what crucial <em>lucky accidents</em> may
      have led those hidden B-brains to persistent concerns with finding
      better ways to learn. Perhaps our educational research should be
      less concerned with teaching children to acquire particular skills
      and more concerned with how we learn to learn.</p>
