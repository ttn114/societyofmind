<h2>16.7 exploitation</h2>

    <p>
      How could any specialist cooperate when it doesn&#39;t understand
      how the others work? We manage to do our worldly work despite that
      same predicament; we deal with people and machines without knowing
      how their insides work. It&#39;s just the same inside the head; each
      part of the mind exploits the rest, not knowing how the other parts
      work but only what they seem to do.</p>

    <p>
      Suppose Thirst knows that water can be found in cups &mdash; but
      does not know how to find or reach for a cup; these are things only
      Find and Get can do. Then Thirst must have some way to exploit the
      abilities of those other agents. Builder, too, has a similar problem
      because most of its subagents cannot communicate directly with one
      another. It would be easy for Thirst or Builder simply to turn on
      other agents like Find and Get. But how will those subordinates know
      what to find or get? Must Thirst transmit to Find a picture of a
      cup? Must Builder send a picture of a brick? The trouble is that
      neither Builder nor Thirst is the sort of agent to contain the kind
      of knowledge required by Find &mdash; namely, the visual appearances
      of things. That kind of knowledge lies inside the memory-machinery
      of See. However, Thirst can achieve its drinking goal by activating
      two connections: one to cause See to <em>hallucinate</em> a cup and
      another connection to activate Find. Find itself can activate Get
      later. This should suffice for Thirst to locate and obtain a cup
      &mdash; if there is one in sight.</p>

    <p>
      This scheme could be unreliable. If See became concerned with
      another object at that moment, Get would acquire the wrong object.
      Infants often disappoint themselves this way. Still, this scheme has
      the kind of simplicity one needs when starting to build any larger
      skill:</p>

    <p>
      one needs a process that sometimes works before one can proceed to
      improve it.</p>

    <p>
      This is merely a sketch of how to build an automatic <em>getting
	machine.</em> We&#39;ll return to this idea much later, when we
      discuss language, because what Thirst and Builder have to do
      resembles what people do when using words. When you say to another
      person,
      <em>Please pass the cup,</em> you don&#39;t emit a picture of a cup
      but merely send a signal that exploits the other person&#39;s
      memory.</p>

    <p>
      Achieving a goal by exploiting the abilities of other agencies might
      seem a shabby substitute for knowing how to do the work oneself. Yet
      this is the very source of the power of societies. No higher-level
      agency could ever achieve a complex goal if it had to be concerned
      with every small detail of what each nerve and muscle does. Unless
      most of its work were done by other agencies, no part of a society
      could do anything significant.</p>
