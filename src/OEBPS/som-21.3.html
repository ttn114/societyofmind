<h2>21.3 Trans-frames</h2>

    <p>
      Whenever we consider an action, such as moving from one place to
      another, we almost always have particular concerns like these:</p>

    <p>
      Where does the action start? Where does it end?  What instrument is
      used? What is its purpose or goal?  What are its effects? What
      difference will it make?</p>

    <p>
      We could represent several of these questions with a simple diagram,
      which we&#39;ll call the Trans-frame.</p>

    <p>
      In the early 1970s, Roger Schank developed ways to represent many
      situations in terms of a relatively few kinds of relations which he
      called <em>conceptual dependencies.</em> One of these, called
      P-Trans, represents a physical motion from one place to
      another. Another, called M-Trans, represents the sort of mental
      transportation involved when John tells Mary his telephone number;
      some information
      <em>moves</em> from John&#39;s memory to Mary&#39;s memory. A third
      type of conceptual dependency, called A-Trans, represents what is
      involved when Mary buys John&#39;s house. The house itself
      doesn&#39;t move at all, but its <em>ownership</em> is transferred
      from John&#39;s estate to Mary&#39;s estate.</p>

    <p>
      But why should we want to represent, in the same way, three such
      different ideas: transportation in space, transmission of ideas, and
      transfer of ownership? I suspect that it is for the same reason that
      our language uses the same word fragment trans for all of them: this
      is one of those pervasive, systematic cross-realm correspondences
      that enables us to apply the same or similar mental skills to many
      different realms of thought. For example, suppose you were to drive
      first from Boston to New York, and then from New York to Washington.
      Obviously the overall effect would be equivalent to driving from
      Boston to Washington &mdash; but that wouldn&#39;t be
      so <em>obvious</em> unless you used a certain kind of mental
      chaining skill. Similarly, if John told you his phone number, and
      you then told it to Mary, this would end up much as though John had
      told Mary directly. And if you first bought John&#39;s house and
      then sold it to Mary, the net result, again, would be as though Mary
      had bought it directly from John. All three forms of Trans-frames
      can be used in chains! This means that once you learn efficient
      chain-manipulating skills, you can apply them to many different
      kinds of situations and actions. Once you know how to do it,
      constructing mental chains seems as easy as stringing beads. All you
      have to do is replace each Trans-frame&#39;s Destination with the
      next one&#39;s Origin.</p>
