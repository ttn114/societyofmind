<h2>11.8 half-brains</h2>

    <p>
      Let&#39;s do one more experiment: touch one ear and then touch your
      nose.  They don&#39;t feel very similar. Now touch one ear and then
      the other.  These touches seem more similar, although they&#39;re
      twice as far apart.  This may be in part because they are
      represented in related agencies. In fact, our brains have many pairs
      of agencies, arranged like mirror- images, with huge bundles of
      nerves running between them.</p>

    <p>
      The two hemispheres of the brain look so alike that they were long
      assumed to be identical. Then it was found that after those
      cross-connections are destroyed, usually only the left brain can
      recognize or speak words, and only the right brain can draw
      pictures.  More recently, when modern methods found other
      differences between those sides, it seems to me that some
      psychologists went mad &mdash; and tried to match those differences
      to every mentalistic two-part theory that ever was conceived. Our
      culture soon became entranced by this revival of an old idea in
      modern guise: that our minds are meeting grounds for pairs of
      antiprinciples. On one side stands the Logical, across from
      Analogical. The left-side brain is Rational; the right side is
      Emotional. No wonder so many seized upon this pseudoscientific
      scheme: it gave new life to nearly every dead idea of how to cleave
      the mental world into two halves as nicely as a peach.</p>

    <p>
      What&#39;s wrong with this is that each brain has many parts, not
      only two. And though there are many differences, we also ought to
      ask about why those left-right brain halves are actually so
      similar. What functions might this serve? For one thing, we know
      that when a major brain area is damaged in a young person, the
      mirror region can sometimes take over its function. Probably even
      when there is no injury, an agency that has consumed all the space
      available in its neighborhood can expand into the mirror region
      across the way.  Another theory: a pair of mirrored agencies could
      be useful for making comparisons and for recognizing differences,
      since if one side could make a copy of its state on the other side
      then, after doing some work, it could compare those initial and
      final states to see what progress had been made.</p>

    <p>
      My own theory of what happens when the cross-connections between
      those brain halves are destroyed is that, in early life, we start
      with mostly similar agencies on either side. Later, as we grow more
      complex, a combination of genetic and circumstantial effects lead
      one of each pair to take control of both. Otherwise, we might become
      paralyzed by conflicts, because many agents would have to serve two
      masters. Eventually, the adult managers for many skills would tend
      to develop on the side of the brain most concerned with language
      because those agencies connect to an unusually large number of other
      agencies. The less dominant side of the brain will continue to
      develop, but with fewer administrative functions &mdash; and end up
      with more of our lower-level skills, but with less involvement in
      plans and higher-level goals that engage many agencies at once. Then
      if, by accident, that brain half is abandoned to itself, it will
      seem more childish and less mature because it lags so far behind in
      administrative growth.</p>
