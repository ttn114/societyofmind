<h2>8.8 societies of memories</h2>

    <p>
      Yesterday, you watched Jack fly his kite. How do you remember
      that today? One answer would be, <em>Remembering it is much like
      seeing it again.</em> But yesterday, when you recognized that
      kite, you didn&#39;t really see it as something wholly new. The
      fact that you recognized it as a <em>kite</em> yesterday means
      that you already saw that kite in terms of even older
      memories.</p>

    <p>
      This suggests two ways to make new memories of what you saw a moment
      ago. One scheme is shown to the left below: you simply connect a new
      K-line to all the agents that were recently active in your mind. The
      other way to make that memory is shown in the diagram to the right
      below: instead of attaching the new K-line to that whole multitude
      of separate agents, connect it only to whichever of your older
      K-lines were active recently. This will lead to a similar result
      since those K-lines were involved in arousing many of the agents
      that were active recently. This second scheme has two advantages: it
      is more economical, and it leads to forming memories as organized
      societies.</p>

    <p>
      Consider that when you realized Jack was flying a kite, this must
      have involved the use of K-lines &mdash; for <em>Jack</em>
      and <em>Fly</em> and <em>Kite</em> &mdash; that had been formed at
      earlier times and were aroused by the sight of Jack flying his
      kite. When those three K-lines were activated, each of them in turn
      activated hundreds or thousands of other agents. (Your state of
      mind, when seeing that scene, resulted from combinations both of
      agents aroused directly by your senses and of agents aroused
      indirectly by your recognitions.) Now, our left-hand memory-scheme
      would need an enormous number of connections to link all those
      agents to the new K-line. But our right-hand scheme would obtain
      much the same effect by attaching the new K-line to only three old
      K-lines! Yet when you reactivate that K-line at some later date, it
      will, in turn, arouse the same K-lines for Jack, Fly, Kite, and
      whichever other recognitions were involved. As a result, you will
      reexperience many of the same recognitions as before. To that
      extent, you will feel and act as though you were back in the same
      situation again.</p>

    <p>
      To be sure, these two types of memories would not produce exactly
      the same results. Our trick of connecting new K-lines to old ones
      will not recapture so many of the scene&#39;s precise, perceptual
      details.</p>

    <p>
      Instead, the kinds of mental states that this <em>hierarchical</em>
      type of memory produces will be based more on stereotypes and
      default assumptions than on actual perceptions. Specifically, you
      will tend to remember only what you recognized at the time. So
      something is lost &mdash; but there&#39;s a gain in
      exchange. These <em>K-line memory-trees</em> lose certain kinds of
      details, but they retain more traces of the origins of our
      ideas. These memory-trees might not serve quite so well if the
      original circumstances were exactly repeated. But that never
      happens, anyway &mdash; and the structured memories will be much
      more easily adapted to new situations.</p>
