<h2>8.11 layers of societies</h2>

    <p>
      According to our concept of memory, the K-lines of each agency grow
      into a new society. So, to keep things straight, let&#39;s call the
      original agents S-agents and call their society the S-society. Given
      any S-society, we can imagine building memories for it by
      constructing a corresponding K-society for it. When we start making
      a K-society, we must link each K-line directly to S-agents, because
      there are no other K-lines we can connect them to. Later we can use
      the more efficient policy of linking new K-lines to old ones. But
      this will lead to a different problem of efficiency: the connections
      to the original S-agents will become increasingly remote and
      indirect. Then everything will begin to slow down &mdash; unless the
      K-society continues to make at least some new connections to the
      original S-society. That would be easy to arrange, if the K-society
      grows in the form of a <em>layer</em> close to its S-society. The
      diagram below suggests such an arrangement.</p>

    <p>
      If arranged this way, the layer pairs could form a curious sort of
      computer. As S-agents excite K-agents and vice versa, a sort of
      spiraling activity would ensue. Over time, the location of that
      activity might tend to drift upward or down and might also tend to
      spread out; without some control, the system might soon become
      chaotic.  But it would be hard to control the system from within,
      nor would that serve the purposes of other agencies. However, we can
      easily imagine how yet another, third agency could confine and
      control the K-S system&#39;s activity &mdash; by specifying which
      level-band should remain active and suppressing all the
      rest. Indeed, that is precisely the sort of coarse control that a
      B-brain might exercise, since it could do all this without needing
      to understand the fine details of what is happening inside the
      A-brain. The third agency might simply look on and say
      impatiently, <em>This isn&#39;t getting anywhere: move up to take a
	higher-level view of the situation.</em> Or it might say, <em>That
	looks like progress, so move farther down and fill in more
	details.</em></p>

    <p>
      Is there any essential difference between the K-and S-societies? Not
      really &mdash; except that the S-society came first. Indeed, we can
      imagine an endless sequence of such societies, in which each new one
      learns to exploit the last. Later we&#39;ll propose that this is how
      our minds develop in infancy &mdash; as sequences of layers of
      societies. Each new layer begins as a set of K-lines, which starts
      by learning to exploit whatever skills have been acquired by the
      previous layer. Whenever a layer acquires some useful and
      substantial skill, it tends to stop learning and changing &mdash;
      and then yet another new layer can begin to learn to exploit the
      capabilities of the last. Each new layer begins as a student,
      learning new ways to use what older layers can already do.  Then it
      slows its learning rate &mdash; and starts to serve both as subject
      and as teacher to the layers that form afterward.</p>
