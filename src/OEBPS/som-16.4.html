<h2>16.4 cross-exclusion</h2>

    <p>
      An ordinary single-bodied animal can only move in one direction
      at a time, and this tends to constrain it to work toward only
      one goal at a time. For example, when such an animal needs water
      urgently, its specialist for <em>thirst</em> takes control;
      however, if cold is paramount, finding warmth takes
      precedence. But if several urgent needs occur at once, there
      must be a way to select one of them. One scheme for this might
      use some sort of central marketplace, in which the urgencies of
      different goals compete and the highest bidder takes control.
      However, that strategy is prone to fall into a funny, fatal
      indecisiveness. To see the problem, imagine that our animal is
      both very hungry and very thirsty.</p>

    <p>
      Suppose that our animal&#39;s hunger is, at first, just slightly
      more urgent than its thirst. So it sets out on a trek toward the
      North Plain, where food is usually found. When it arrives and takes</p>

    <p>
      a bite of food, its thirst instantly takes precedence over its need
      for food!</p>

    <p>
      Now that thirst has top priority, our animal sets out on the long
      journey toward South Lake. But once it arrives and takes one
      satisfying sip, the balance instantly tips back to food. Our animal
      is doomed to journey back and forth, getting hungrier and
      thirstier. Each action only equalizes ever-growing urgencies.</p>

    <p>
      This would be no problem at a dinner table, where food and drink are
      both within easy reach. But under natural conditions, no animal
      could survive the waste of energy, when every minor fluctuation
      caused a major change in strategy. One way to manage this would be
      to use that <em>marketplace</em> infrequently &mdash; but that would
      make our animal less capable of dealing with emergencies. Another
      way is to use an arrangement called cross-exclusion, which appears
      in many portions of the brain. In such a system, each member of a
      group of agents is wired to send <em>inhibitory</em> signals to all
      the other agents of that group. This makes them competitors. When
      any agent of such a group is aroused, its signals tend to inhibit
      the others. This leads to an avalanche effect &mdash; as each
      competitor grows weaker, its ability to inhibit its challengers also
      weakens. The result is that even if the initial difference between
      competitors is small, the most active agent will quickly <em>lock
	out</em> all the others.</p>

    <p>
      Cross-exclusion arrangements could provide a basis for the principle
      of <em>noncompromise</em> in regions of the brain where competitive
      mental agents lie close together. Cross-exclusion groups can also be
      used to construct short-term memory-units. Whenever we force one
      agent of such a group into activity, even for a moment, it will
      remain active (and the others will remain suppressed) until the
      situation is changed by some other strong external influence. Weaker
      external signals will have scarcely any effect at all because of
      resistance from within.  Why call this a short-term memory if it can
      persist indefinitely?  Because when it does get changed, no trace
      will remain of its previous state.</p>
