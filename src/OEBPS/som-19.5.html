<h2>19.5 polynemes</h2>

    <p>
      What happens when a single agent sends messages to several different
      agencies? In many cases, such a message will have a different effect
      on each of those other agencies. As I mentioned earlier, I&#39;ll
      call such an agent a <em>polyneme.</em> For example, your word-agent
      for the word <em>apple</em> must be a polyneme because it sets your
      agencies for color, shape, and size into unrelated states that
      represent the independent properties of being red, round, and
      <em>apple-sized.</em></p>

    <p>
      But how could the same message come to have such diverse effects on
      so many agencies, with each effect so specifically appropriate to
      the idea of <em>apple</em>? There is only one explanation: Each of
      those other agencies must already have learned its own response to
      that same signal. Because polynemes, like politicians, mean
      different things to different listeners, each listener must learn
      its own, different way to react to that message. (The prefix poly-
      is to suggest diversity, and the suffix -neme is to indicate how
      this depends on memory.)</p>

    <p>
      To understand a polyneme, each agency must learn its own specific
      and appropriate response. Each agency must have its private
      dictionary or memory bank to tell it how to respond to every
      polyneme.</p>

    <p>
      How could all those agencies learn how to respond to each polyneme?
      If each polyneme were connected to a K-line in each agency, each of
      those K-lines would need only to learn what partial state to arouse
      inside its agency. The drawing below suggests that those K-lines
      could form little <em>memorizers</em> next to the agencies that they
      affect.  Thus, memories are formed and stored close to the places
      where they are used.</p>

    <p>
      Can any simple scheme like this give rise to all the richness of the
      meaning of a real language-word? The answer is that all ideas about
      meaning will seem inadequate by themselves, since nothing can mean
      anything except within some larger context of ideas.</p>
