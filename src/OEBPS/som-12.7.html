<h2>12.7 accumulation strategies</h2>

    <p>
      Let&#39;s make a dumbbell theory of some people&#39;s personalities.</p>

    <p>
      Uniframers disregard discrepancies in favor of imagined
      regularities. They tend to be perfectionists but also tend to think
      in terms of stereotypes. This sometimes leads to recklessness
      because they have to reject some evidence in order to make their
      uniframes.
      
      Accumulators are less extreme. They keep collecting evidence and
      hence are much less prone to make mistakes. But then they&#39;re
      also slower to make discoveries.</p>

    <p>
      Of course these imaginary personalities are only caricatures, and
      everyone blends both extremes. Most people find some reasonable
      compromise, though a few of us lean more in one direction than the
      other. I&#39;m sure we all use mixtures of different learning
      strategies</p>

    <p>
      &mdash; accumulations of descriptions, K-lines, uniframes, or
      whatever. On the surface, it might seem easier to make accumulations
      than to make uniframes &mdash; but choosing what to accumulate may
      require deeper insight. In any case, whenever an accumulation
      becomes too large and clumsy, we try to replace some groups of its
      members with a uniframe. But even when we succeed in finding a
      suitably compact uniframe, we can expect it, too, to accumulate
      exceptions eventually, since first descriptions rarely work for all
      our later purposes.</p>

    <p>
      For example, when a child first encounters dogs, an attempt might be
      made to create a uniframe that catalogs those animals&#39; parts
      &mdash; eyes, ears, teeth, head, body, tail, legs, and so on. But
      the child will eventually have to learn that even here there are
      exceptions.</p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, that uniframe won&#39;t help answer the child&#39;s
      most urgent questions about any one dog in particular: Is it
      friendly? Does it have a loud bark? Is it the kind that tends to
      bite? Each such concern could require building a different kind of
      hierarchy-tree.</p>

    <p>
      This leads to an inescapable difficulty. Our various motives and
      concerns are likely to require incompatible ways to classify things.
      You can&#39;t predict a dog&#39;s bite from its bark. Each of the
      classifications we build must embody different kinds of knowledge,
      and we can rarely use more than a few of them at once. When we have
      a goal that is simple and clear, we may be able to select one
      particular kind of description that makes the problem easy to
      solve. But when goals of several types conflict, it is harder to
      know just what to do.</p>
