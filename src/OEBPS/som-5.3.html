<h2>5.3 the remote-control self</h2>

    <p> When people have no answers to important questions, they often
      give some anyway.</p>

      To help us think about how our minds are connected to the outer world,
      our culture teaches schemes like this:</p>
    <img class="illus" src="./illus/ch5/5-1.png"/>
    <p>
      This diagram depicts our sensory machinery as sending information to the
      brain, wherein it is projected on some inner mental movie screen.  Then,
      inside that ghostly theater, a lurking Self observes the scene and then
      considers what to do. Finally, that Self may act &mdash; somehow
      reversing all those steps &mdash; to influence the real world by sending
      various signals back through yet another family of remote-control
      accessories.</p>

    <p>
      This concept simply doesn&#39;t work. It cannot help for you to think
      that inside yourself lies someone else who does your work. This notion
      of
      <em>homunculus</em> &mdash; a little person inside each self &mdash;
      leads only to a paradox since, then, that inner Self requires yet
      another movie screen inside itself, on which to project what it has
      seen! And then, to watch that play-within-a-play, we&#39;d need yet
      another Self-inside-a-Self &mdash; to do the thinking for the last. And
      then this would all repeat again, as each new Self requires yet another
      one to do its job!</p>

    <p>
      The idea of a single, central Self doesn&#39;t explain anything.  This
      is because a thing with no parts provides nothing that we can use as
      pieces of explanation!</p>

    <p>
      Then why do we so often embrace the strange idea that what we do is done
      by Someone Else &mdash; that is, our Self? Because so much of what our
      minds do is hidden from the parts of us that are involved with
      consciousness.</p>
