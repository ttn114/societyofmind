<h2>24.4 default assumptions</h2>

    <p>
      When someone says, <em>John threw a ball,</em> you probably
      unconsciously assume a certain set of features and qualities of the
      ball, like color, size, and weight. These are your assumptions by
      default, the kind we talked about when we first introduced the idea
      of level-bands. Your assumptions about that ball might be derived
      from some ball you owned long ago &mdash; or, possibly, your newest
      one. It is our theory that such optional details are usually
      attached too weakly to hold against the sharp insistence of reality,
      so that other stimuli will find them easy to detach or otherwise
      adapt. This is why default assumptions make weak images, and why we
      aren&#39;t too amazed when they turn out wrong. It is no surprise
      that frames share so many properties of K-lines, since the terminals
      of frames themselves will lie in level-bands near the K-lines whose
      fringes represent our expectations and default assumptions.</p>

    <p>
      But why use default assumptions at all, instead of simply seeing
      what&#39;s really there? Because unless we make assumptions, the
      world would simply make no sense. It would be as useless to perceive
      how things <em>actually look</em> as it would be to watch the random
      dots on untuned television screens. What really matters is being
      able to see what things look like. This is why our brains need
      special machinery for representing what we see in terms of
      distinct <em>objects.</em> The very idea of an object embodies
      making many assumptions that <em>go without saying</em> &mdash; for
      example, that it has substance and boundaries, that it existed
      before we saw it, and that it will remain afterward &mdash; in
      short, that it will act like other typical objects. Thus, though we
      never see every side of an object at once, we always assume that its
      unseen sides exist. I suspect that the larger part of what we know
      &mdash; or think we know &mdash; is represented by default
      assumptions, because there is so little that we know with perfect
      certainty.</p>

    <p>
      We use default assumptions in personal relations, too. Why do so
      many people give such credence to astrology, to classify friends by
      the months of their births? Perhaps it seems a forward step, to
      class all persons into just twelve types &mdash; to those who once
      supposed that there were less. And how does the writer&#39;s craft
      evoke such lifelike characters? It&#39;s ridiculous to think that
      people could be well portrayed in so few words. Instead, our story
      writers use phrases that activate great networks of assumptions that
      already lie in the minds of their readers. It takes great skill to
      create those illusions &mdash; to activate unknown processes in
      unknown readers&#39; minds and to shape them to one&#39;s
      purposes. Indeed, in doing so, a writer can make things clearer than
      reality. For although words are merely catalysts for starting mental
      processes, so, too, are real things: we can&#39;t sense what they
      really are, only what they remind us of. As Proust went on to say:</p>

    <p>
      Each reader reads only what is already inside himself. A book is
      only a sort of optical instrument which the writer offers to let the
      reader discover in himself what he would not have found without the
      aid of the book.</p>
