<h2>7.8 difference-engines</h2>

    <p>
      Whenever we talk about a <em>goal,</em> we mix a thousand meanings in
      one word. Goals are linked to all the unknown agencies that are engaged
      whenever we try to change ourselves or the outside world. If
      <em>goal</em> involves so many things, why tie them all to a single
      word?  Here&#39;s some of what we usually expect when we think that
      someone has a goal:</p>

    <p>
      A <em>goal-driven</em> system does not seem to react directly to the
      stimuli or situations it encounters. Instead, it treats the things it
      finds as objects to exploit, avoid, or ignore, as though it were
      concerned with something else that doesn&#39;t yet exist. When any
      disturbance or obstacle diverts a goal-directed system from its course,
      that system seems to try to remove the interference, go around it, or
      turn it to some advantage.</p>

    <p>
      What kind of process inside a machine could give the impression of
      having a goal &mdash; of purpose, persistence, and directedness? There
      is indeed a certain particular type of machine that appears to have
      those qualities; it is built according to the principles below, which
      were first studied in the late 1950s by Allen Newell, C. J. Shaw, and
      Herbert A. Simon. Originally, these systems were called general problem
      solvers, but I&#39;ll simply call them difference-engines.</p>

    <p>
      A difference-engine must contain a description of a <em>desired</em>
      situation.
      
      It must have subagents that are aroused by various differences between
      the desired situation and the actual situation.
      
      Each subagent must act in a way that tends to diminish the difference
      that aroused it.</p>

    <p>
      At first, this may seem both too simple and too complicated.
      Psychologically, a difference-engine might appear to be too primitive to
      represent the complex of ambitions, frustrations, satisfactions, and
      disappointments involved in the pursuit of a human goal. But these
      aren&#39;t really aspects of our goals themselves but emerge from the
      interactions among the many agencies that become engaged in pursuit of
      those goals. On the other side, one might wonder whether the notion of a
      goal really needs to engage such a complicated four-way relationship
      among agents, situations, descriptions, and differences. Presently
      we&#39;ll see that this is actually simpler than it seems, because most
      agents are already concerned with differences.</p>
