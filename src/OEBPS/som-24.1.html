<h1>24 Frames</h1>
<h2>24.1 the speed of thought</h2>


    <p>
      When we enter a room, we seem to see the entire scene at a glance.
      But, really, it takes time to see &mdash; to apprehend all the
      details and see if they confirm our expectations and beliefs. Our
      first impressions often have to be revised. Still, one wonders how
      so many kinds of visual cues can lead so quickly to consistent
      views. What could explain the blinding speed of sight?</p>

    <p>
      The secret is that sight is intertwined with memory. When face to
      face with someone you&#39;ve just met, you seem to react almost
      instantly &mdash; but not as much to what you see as to what that
      sight <em>reminds</em> you of.  The moment you sense the presence of
      a person, a whole world of assumptions is aroused that are usually
      true about people in general.  At the same time, certain superficial
      cues remind you of particular people you&#39;ve already
      met. Unconsciously, then, you will assume that this stranger must
      also resemble them, not only in appearance but in other traits as
      well. No amount of self-discipline can keep those superficial
      similarities from provoking assumptions that may then affect your
      judgments and decisions. When we disapprove of this, we complain
      about stereotypes &mdash; and when we sympathize with it, we speak
      of sensitivity and empathy.</p>

    <p>
      It&#39;s much the same with language, too. If someone
      said, <em>It&#39;s raining frogs,</em> your mind would swiftly
      fill with thoughts about the origins of those frogs, about what
      happens to them when they hit the ground, about what could have
      caused that peculiar plague, and about whether or not the
      announcer had gone mad. Yet the stimulus for all of this is just
      three words. How do our minds conceive such complex scenes from
      such sparse cues? The additional details must come from memories
      and reasoning.</p>

    <p>
      Most older theories in psychology could not account for how a mind
      could do such things &mdash; because, I think, those theories were
      based on ideas about <em>chunks</em> of memory that were either much
      too small or much too large. Some of those theories tried to explain
      appearances only in terms of low-level <em>cues,</em> while other
      theories tried to deal with entire scenes at once. None of those
      theories ever got very far.  The next few sections describe what
      seems to be a useful compromise; at least it has led to some better
      results in some projects concerned with Artificial Intelligence. Our
      idea is that each perceptual experience activates some structures
      that we&#39;ll call frames &mdash; structures we&#39;ve acquired in
      the course of previous experience. We all remember millions of
      frames, each representing some stereotyped situation like meeting a
      certain kind of person, being in a certain kind of room, or
      attending a certain kind of party.</p>
