<h1>13 Seeing And Believing</h1>
<h2>13.1 reformulation</h2>

    <p>
      Imagine all the kinds of arches one can build.</p>

    <p>
      How could we capture what&#39;s common to so many things with just
      one single uniframe? Impossible &mdash; if we were forced to think
      of them in terms of blocks and how they&#39;re placed. Not one of
      the expressions we used before applies to all of them:
      neither <em>three blocks,</em> nor <em>two blocks standing up,</em>
      nor <em>the supports must not touch.</em> How could we make our
      minds perceive all these arches as the same? One way would be to
      draw this imaginary line:</p>
<img class="illus" src="./illus/ch13/13-2.png" />

    <p>
      Now, suddenly, all those different arches fit one single frame
      &mdash; of a single Body with two Supports. There are two different
      ideas here.  The first is the idea of dividing an object&#39;s
      description into an
      <em>essential</em> portion, namely the <em>body,</em> and some
      auxiliary portions, which correspond to the support. Later we&#39;ll
      see that this is a powerful idea in its own right. The second idea
      is even more powerful and general: after failing to find a unified
      description of all those arches, we abandoned the method we were
      using &mdash; and adopted, instead, a quite different style of
      description. In a word, we reformulated the problem in new terms. We
      started by using a language that was based on expressing the precise
      shapes of individual blocks. We replaced this by another language in
      which we can speak of shapes and outlines that are not confined to
      those of the blocks themselves.</p>

    <p>
      Reformulation is clearly very powerful &mdash; but how does one do
      it?  How do people find new styles of description that make their
      problems seem easier? Does this depend upon some mysterious kind of
      insight or upon some magically creative gift &mdash; or do we simply
      come upon them by accident? As I said when discussing creativity,
      these seem to me mere matters of degree, since people are always
      making reformulations of various sorts. Even when we contemplate
      those rarest and most revolutionary new ideas that come like
      revelations, suddenly to shed new light on entire fields of thought
      &mdash; like evolution, gravity, or relativity &mdash; we usually
      see by hindsight that these were variants of things that people knew
      before that time. Then we have to ask, instead, for reasons why
      those reformulations were so long postponed.</p>
