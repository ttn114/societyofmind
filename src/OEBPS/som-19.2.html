<h2>19.2 the language-agency</h2>

    <p>
      We&#39;re normally quite unaware of how our brain-machines enable us
      to see, or walk, or remember what we want. And we&#39;re equally
      unaware of how we speak or of how we comprehend the words we
      hear. As far as consciousness can tell, no sooner do we hear a
      phrase than all its meanings spring to mind &mdash; yet we have no
      conscious sense of how those words produce their effects. Consider
      that all children learn to speak and understand &mdash; yet few
      adults will ever recognize the regularities of their grammars. For
      example, all English speakers learn that saying <em>big brown
	dog</em> is right, while <em>brown big dog</em> is somehow
      wrong. How do we learn which phrases are admissible? No language
      scientist even knows whether brains must learn this once or twice
      &mdash; first, for knowing what to say, and second, for knowing what
      to hear. Do we reuse the same machinery for both? Our conscious
      minds just cannot tell, since consciousness does not reveal how
      language works.</p>

    <p>
      However, on the other side, language seems to play a role in much of
      what our consciousness does. I suspect that this is because our
      language-agency plays special roles in how we think, through having
      a great deal of control over the memory-systems in other agencies
      and therefore over the huge accumulations of knowledge they
      contain. But language is only a part of thought. We sometimes seem
      to think in words &mdash; and sometimes not. What do we <em>think
	in</em> when we aren&#39;t using words? And how do the agents that
      work with words communicate with those that don&#39;t? Since no one
      knows, we&#39;ll have to make a theory. We&#39;ll start by imagining
      that the language-system is divided into three regions.</p>

    <p>
      The upper region contains agents that are concerned specifically
      with words. The lower region includes all the agencies that are
      affected by words. And in the center lie the agencies involved with
      how words engage our recollections, expectations, and other kinds of
      mental processes. There is also one peculiarity: the language-agency
      seems to have an unusual capacity to control its own memories. Our
      diagram suggests that this could be because the language-agency can
      exploit itself as though it were just another agency.</p>
