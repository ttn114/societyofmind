<h2>29.6 autistic children</h2>

    <p>
      Isn&#39;t it curious that infants find social goals easier to
      accomplish than physical goals, while adults find the social goals
      more difficult? One way to explain this is to say that the presence
      of helpful people simplifies the infant&#39;s social world &mdash;
      since because of them, simpler actions solve harder
      problems. Another explanation might be that the infant&#39;s social
      world is just as complicated as that of the adult, except the
      presence of helpful people makes the infant&#39;s mind more powerful
      &mdash; by making the agencies inside those other people&#39;s
      brains available for exploitation by the agencies in the
      infant&#39;s brain. Both explanations are the same, except for
      drawing different boundaries.</p>

    <p>
      How do children start on the path toward distinguishing between
      psychological and physical relationships? In the appendix I&#39;ll
      suggest that our infant brains are genetically equipped with
      machinery for making it easy to learn social signals. But what if
      that machinery should somehow fail, so that by chance &mdash; or by
      neglect or accident &mdash; the realm-divisions never form? Then all
      those different kinds of thoughts would fuse together into one
      &mdash; and the child would face the impossible task of formulating
      principles that work in all domains. A child that tried to see the
      world without dividing it into realms would find no simple rules at
      all that work across so large a range.</p>

    <p>
      This is why each child must learn different rules for the physical
      and psychological realms. But this means that the child must face
      not merely two formidable problems, but three. In addition to
      developing two different sets of concepts, the child must also
      develop agencies to manage those concepts by keeping them apart in
      different agencies, as we saw when we talked about Papert&#39;s
      principle.</p>

    <p>
      This could explain some aspects of the disorders of the children
      psychiatrists call <em>autistic.</em> These unhappy individuals do
      not establish effective communication with other people, although
      they may acquire some competence at dealing with physical things. No
      one knows the causes of those disorders. Some might begin when
      certain mental realms do not develop normally. Other kinds of
      problems could emerge after those divisions form, if their
      separateness were compromised by some too intense attempt to unify
      them. To be sure, that is what scientists do, but unlike those whom
      we regard as mentally ill, scientists also manage to maintain their
      ordinary views.  Once a child is deprived of the normal ways to
      divide those realms &mdash; no matter what the cause of this &mdash;
      that hapless mind is doomed to fail.</p>
