<h2>23.3 time blinking</h2>

    <p>
      Fortunately, there is a way to get around the duplication problem
      entirely. Let&#39;s take a cue from how a perfume makes a strong
      impression first, but then appears to fade away, or how, when you
      put your hand in water that is very hot or very cold, the sensation
      is intense at first &mdash; but will soon disappear almost
      entirely. As we say, we <em>get used to</em> these sensations. Why?
      Because our senses react mainly to how things change in time. This
      is true even for the sensors in our eyes &mdash; though normally
      we&#39;re unaware of it because our eyes are always moving
      imperceptibly. Most of the sensory agents that inform our brains
      about the world are sensitive only to various sorts of time changes
      &mdash; and that, surely, is also true of most of the agents inside
      the brain.</p>

    <p>
      Any agent that is sensitive to changes in time can also be used to
      detect differences. For whenever we expose such an agent, first to a
      situation A and then to a situation B, any output from</p>

    <p>
      that agent will signify some difference between A and B.</p>

    <p>
      This suggests a way to solve the duplication problem. Since most
      agents can be made to serve as difference-agents, we can compare two
      descriptions simply by presenting them to the same agency at
      different times. This is easily done if that agency is equipped with
      a pair of high-speed, temporary K-line memories. Then we need only
      load the two descriptions into those memories and compare them by
      activating first one and then the other.</p>

    <p>
      Store the first description in pronome p.  Store the second
      description in pronome q.  Activate p and q in rapid succession.
      Then any changes in the agents&#39; outputs represent differences
      between A and B!</p>

    <p>
      We can use this trick to implement the scheme we described for
      escaping from a topless-arch. Suppose that p describes the present
      situation and q describes a box that permits no escape. Each Move
      agent is designed to detect the appearance of a wall. If we
      simply <em>blink</em></p>

    <p>
      from the present situation to the box frame, one of these agents
      will announce the appearance of any box wall that was not already
      apparent in the present situation. Thus, automatically, this scheme
      will find all the directions that are not closed off. If the outputs
      of the Move agents were connected to cause you to move in the
      corresponding direction, this agency would lead you to escape!</p>

    <p>
      The method of time blinking can also be used to simplify our
      difference-engine scheme for composing verbal expressions, since now
      the speaker can maintain both p and q inside the selfsame agency. If
      not for this, each speaker would need what would amount to a
      duplicate society of mind in order to simulate the listener&#39;s
      state. Although the method of time blinking is powerful and
      efficient, it has some limitations; for example, it cannot directly
      recognize relations among more than two things at a time. I suspect
      that people share this limitation, too &mdash; and this may be why
      we have relatively few language-forms, like <em>between</em>
      and <em>middle,</em> for expressing three-way comparisons and
      relationships.</p>
