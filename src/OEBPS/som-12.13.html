<h2>12.13 bridge-definitions</h2>

    <p>
      At last we&#39;re coming close to capturing the meanings of things
      like chairs and games. We found that structural descriptions are
      useful, but they always seem too specific. Most chairs have legs,
      and most games have scores &mdash; but there are always
      exceptions. We also found purposeful descriptions to be useful, but
      they never seemed specific enough. <em>Thing you can sit upon</em>
      is too general to specify a chair, since you can sit on almost
      anything. <em>Diverting activity</em> is too broad for game &mdash;
      since there are many other ways to turn our minds from serious
      things. In general, a single definition rarely works.</p>

    <p>
      Purposeful definitions are usually too loose.  They include many
      things we do not intend.  Structural definitions are usually too
      tight.  They reject many things we want to include.</p>

    <p>
      But we can often capture an idea by squeezing in from several sides
      at once, to get exactly what we need by using two or more different
      kinds of descriptions at the same time.</p>

    <p>
      Our best ideas are often those that bridge between two different
      worlds!</p>

    <p>
      I don&#39;t insist that every definition combine just these
      particular ingredients of structure and purpose. But that specific
      mixture does have a peculiar virtue: it helps us bridge between
      the <em>ends</em> we seek and the <em>means</em> we have. That is,
      it helps us connect things we can recognize (or make, find, do, or
      think) to problems we want to solve.  It would be of little use to
      know that X&#39;s <em>exist</em> without some way to find and use
      them.</p>

    <p>
      When we discussed accumulation, we saw that the concepts of
      <em>furniture</em> and <em>money</em> have reasonably compact
      functional definitions but accumulate many structural
      descriptions. Conversely, the concepts of <em>square</em>
      or <em>circle</em> have compact structural definitions but
      accumulate endless collections of possible uses.</p>

    <p>
      To learn to use a new or unfamiliar word, you start by taking it to
      be a sign that there exists, inside some other person&#39;s mind, a
      structure you could use. But no matter how carefully it is
      explained, you must still rebuild that thought yourself, from
      materials already in your own mind. It helps to be given a good
      definition, but still you must mold and shape each new idea to suit
      your own existing skills &mdash; hoping to make it work for you the
      way it seems to work for those from whom you learn.</p>

    <p>
      What people call <em>meanings</em> do not usually correspond to
      particular and definite structures, but to connections among and
      across fragments of the great interlocking networks of connections
      and constraints among our agencies. Because these networks are
      constantly growing and changing, meanings are rarely sharp, and we
      cannot always expect to be able to <em>define</em> them in terms of
      compact sequences of words. Verbal explanations serve only as
      partial hints; we also have to learn from watching, working, playing
      &mdash; and thinking.</p>
