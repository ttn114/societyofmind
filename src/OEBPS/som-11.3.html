<h2>11.3 nearnesses</h2>

    <p>
      The reason our skin can feel is because we&#39;re built with myriad
      nerves that run from every skin spot to the brain. In general, each
      pair of nearby places on the skin is wired to nearby places in the
      brain. This is because those nerves tend to run in bundles of
      parallel fibers &mdash; more or less like this:</p>

    <p>
      Each sensory experience involves the activity of many different
      sensors. In general, the greater the extent to which two stimuli
      arouse the same sensors, the more nearly alike will be the partial
      mental states those stimuli produce &mdash; and the more similar
      those stimuli will <em>seem,</em> simply because they&#39;ll tend to
      lead to similar mental consequences.</p>

    <p>
      Other things being equal, the apparent similarity of two stimuli
      will depend on the extent to which they lead to similar activities
      in other agencies.</p>

    <p>
      The fact that the nerves from skin to brain tend to run in parallel
      bundles means that stimulating nearby spots of skin will usually
      lead to rather similar activities inside the brain. In the next
      section we&#39;ll see how this could enable an agency inside the
      brain to discover the spatial layout of the skin. For example, as
      you move a finger along your skin, new nerve endings are stimulated
      &mdash; and it is safe to assume that the new arrivals represent
      spots of skin along the advancing edge of your finger.</p>

    <p>
      Given enough such information, a suitably designed agency could
      assemble a sort of map to represent which spots are close together
      on the skin. Because there are many irregularities in the
      nerve-bundle pathways from skin to brain, the agencies that
      construct those maps must be able to <em>tidy things up.</em> For
      example, the mapping agency must learn to correct the sort of
      crossing-over shown in the diagram.  But that is only the beginning
      of the task. For a child, learning about the spatial world beyond
      the skin is a journey that stretches over many years.</p>
