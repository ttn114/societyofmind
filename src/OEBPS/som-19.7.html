<h2>19.7 weighing evidence</h2>

    <p>
      There are important variations on the theme of <em>weighing
	evidence.</em>  Our first idea was just to count the bits of
      evidence in favor of an object&#39;s being a chair. But not all bits
      of evidence are equally valuable, so we can improve our scheme by
      giving different <em>weights</em> to different kinds of evidence.</p>

    <p>
      How could we prevent this chair recognizer from accepting a table
      that appeared to be composed of four legs and a seat? One approach
      would be to try to rearrange the weights to avoid this. But if we
      already possessed a table recognizer, we could use its output as
      evidence against there being a chair by adding it in with a negative
      weight! How should one decide what number weights to assign to each
      feature? In 1959, Frank Rosenblatt invented an ingenious
      evidence-weighing machine called a <em>Perceptron.</em> It was
      equipped with a procedure that automatically learned which weights
      to use from being told by a teacher which of the distinctions it
      made were unacceptable.</p>

    <p>
      All feature-weighing machines have serious limitations because,
      although they can measure the presence or absence of various
      features, they cannot take into account enough of the relations
      among those features. For example, in the book Perceptrons, Seymour
      Papert and I proved mathematically that no feature-weighing machine
      can distinguish between the two kinds of patterns drawn below
      &mdash; no matter how cleverly we choose the weights.</p>

    <p>
      Both drawings on the left depict patterns that are connected &mdash;
      that is, that can be drawn with a single line. The patterns on the
      right are disconnected in the sense of needing two separate
      lines. Here is a way to prove that no feature-weighing machine can
      recognize this sort of distinction. Suppose that you chopped each
      picture into a heap of tiny pieces. It would be impossible to say
      which heaps came from connected drawings and which came from
      disconnected drawings &mdash; simply because each heap would contain
      identical assortments of picture fragments! Every heap would contain
      exactly four pictures of right-angle turns, two <em>line
	endings,</em> and the same total lengths of horizontal and vertical
      line segments. It is therefore impossible to distinguish one heap
      from another by <em>adding up the evidence,</em> because all
      information about the relations between the bits of evidence has
      been lost.</p>
