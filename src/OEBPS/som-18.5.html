<h2>18.5 strong arguments</h2>

    <p>
      When people disagree, we often say that one side&#39;s position
      seems
      <em>stronger</em> than the other. But what has <em>strength</em> to
      do with reasoning? In logic, arguments are simply either right or
      wrong, since there is not the slightest room for matters of
      degree. But in real life, few arguments are ever absolutely sure, so
      we simply have to learn how various forms of reasoning are likely to
      go wrong. Then we can use different methods to make our chains of
      reasoning harder to break. One method is to use several different
      arguments to prove the same point &mdash; putting them <em>in
	parallel.</em> By analogy, when you park a car on a steep hill, it
      isn&#39;t safe to depend on brakes alone. No brake can work unless
      all its parts do &mdash; and, unhappily, all those parts form a long
      and slender chain no stronger than its weakest link.</p>

    <p>
      -- Driver&#39;s foot presses on brake pedal.  --- Brake pedal forces
      piston into master cylinder.  ---- This forces brake fluid to flow
      from cylinder.</p>

    <p>
      -----Brake fluid flows through tubes to brakes at wheels.
      ------Pistons in brake cylinders apply force to brake shoes.
      -------Brake shoes press on wheel drums, stopping wheels.</p>

    <p>
      An expert driver also leaves the car in gear and turns the wheels
      into the curb. Then, though no one of these tricks is perfectly
      secure, the combination cannot fail unless three things go wrong at
      once. This whole is stronger than any of its parts.</p>

      A chain can break with any single injury, but a parallel bundle
      cannot fail unless every one of its links has been broken. Our car
      can&#39;t roll away unless all three &mdash; brake, wheel, and
      parking gear &mdash; go wrong at once. Parallel bundles and serial
      chains are only the simplest ways to link together various
      parts. Here are some others.</p>

    <p>
      Each serial connection makes a structure weaker, while each parallel
      connection makes it stronger.</p>
