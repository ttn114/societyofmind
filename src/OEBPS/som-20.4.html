<h2>20.4 locking-in and weeding-out</h2>

    <p>
      Most language-words are linked to many different polynemes, which
      correspond to the many <em>meaning-senses</em> of each word. To
      arouse so many polynemes at once would often lead to conflicts as
      each tries to set one&#39;s agencies into different states at the
      same time. If there are no other contextual clues, some of these
      conflicts would be resolved in accord with their connection
      strengths. For example, upon hearing
      <em>The astronomer married the star,</em> a playwright would tend to
      give priority to the theatrical sense of <em>star,</em> whereas an
      astronomer would think first of a distant sun, other things being
      equal.</p>

    <p>
      But other things are not usually equal. At every moment a
      person&#39;s mind is already involved with some <em>context</em> in
      which many agents are actively aroused. Because of this, as each new
      word arouses different polynemes, these will compete to change the
      states of those agents. Some of those changes will gain support as
      certain combinations of agents reinforce one another. Others that
      lose support and are left to stand alone will tend to weaken, and
      most ambiguities will thus be weeded out. In a few cycles, the
      entire system will firmly <em>lock in</em> on one meaning-sense for
      each word and firmly suppress the rest.</p>

    <p>
      A computer program that actually worked this way was developed by
      Jordan Pollack and David Waltz. When applied to the
      sentence, <em>John shot two bucks,</em> and supplied with the
      faintest context clue, the program would indeed usually settle into
      a single, consistent interpretation. In other words, after a few
      cycles, the agents ended up in a pattern of mutually supporting
      activities in which only one sense of each word remained strongly
      active while all the other meaning- senses were
      suppressed. Thereafter, whether this <em>alliance</em> of
      word-senses was involved with hunting or with gambling, it became so
      self-supporting that it could resist any subsequent small signal
      from outside. In effect, the system had found a stable, unambiguous
      interpretation of the sentence.</p>

    <p>
      What can be done if such a system settles on a wrong interpretation?
      Suppose, for example, that an <em>outdoors</em> clue had already
      made the system decide that John was hunting, but later it was told
      that John was gambling in the woods. Since a single new context clue
      might not be able to overcome an established alliance of
      meaning-senses, it might be necessary for some higher-level agency
      to start the system out afresh.  What if the end result of
      locking-in were unacceptable to other agencies? Simply repeating the
      process would only lead to making the same mistake again. One way to
      prevent that would be to record which meaning-senses were adopted in
      the previous cycle and suppress them temporarily at the start of the
      next cycle. This would probably produce a new interpretation.</p>

    <p>
      There is no guarantee that this method will always find an
      interpretation that yields a meaning consistent with all the words
      of the sentence. Then, if the locking-in process should fail, the
      listener will be confused. There are other methods that one could
      attempt, for example, to imagine a new context and then restart the
      ring-closing process. But no single method will always work. To use
      the power of language, one must acquire many different ways to
      understand.</p>
