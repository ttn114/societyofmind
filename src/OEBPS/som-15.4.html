<h2>15.4 memories of memories</h2>

    <p>
      Ask anyone for memories from childhood, and everyone will readily
      produce a handful of stories like this:</p>

    <p>
      My neighbor&#39;s father died when I was four. I remember sitting
      with my friend in front of their house, watching people come and
      go. It was strange. No one said anything.</p>

    <p>
      It&#39;s hard to distinguish memories from memories of memories.
      Indeed, there&#39;s little evidence that any of our adult memories
      really go way back to infancy; what seem like early memories may be
      nothing more than reconstructions of our older thoughts. For one
      thing, recollections from our first five years seem strangely
      isolated; if we ask what happened earlier that day, the answer
      almost always is,
      <em>I can&#39;t remember that.</em> Furthermore, many of those early
      memories involve incidents so significant that they probably
      occupied the child&#39;s mind repeatedly over a period of
      years. Most suspicious of all is the fact that such recollections
      are frequently described as seen through other, older eyes &mdash;
      with the narrator portrayed inside the scene, right near the center
      of the stage. Since we never actually see ourselves, these must be
      reconstructed memories, rehearsed and reformulated since infancy.</p>

    <p>
      I suspect that this <em>amnesia of infancy</em> is no mere effect of
      decay over time but an inevitable result of growing out of
      infancy. A memory is not a separate entity, apart from how it works
      upon the mind. To remember an early experience, you must be able not
      only to <em>retrieve</em> some old records, but to reconstruct how
      your earlier mind reacted to them &mdash; and to do that, you would
      have to become an infant again. To outgrow infancy, you have to
      sacrifice your memories because they&#39;re written in an ancient
      script that your later selves can no longer read.</p>

    <p>
      We reconstruct our recent memories as well, since they portray less
      what we saw than what we recognized. From every moment to the next,
      your mental state is shaped not only by signals from the outer
      world, but by agents activated by the memories these evoke. For
      example, when you see a chair, what makes it appear to you to be a
      chair &mdash; rather than an assortment of sticks and boards? It
      must evoke some memories. Only a part of your impression comes from
      agents activated directly by your vision; most of what your
      higher-level agencies experience comes from the memories those
      vision-agents activate. Usually, we have no conscious sense of this
      happening, and we never use words like <em>memory</em>
      or <em>remembering</em> when the process works quickly and quietly;
      instead, we speak of <em>seeing</em> or
      <em>recognizing</em> or <em>knowing.</em> This is because such
      processes leave too few traces for the rest of the mind to
      contemplate; accordingly, such processes are unconscious, because
      consciousness requires short-term memory. It is only when a
      recognition involves substantial time and effort that we speak
      of <em>remembering.</em></p>

    <p>
      Then what do we mean by <em>memory</em>? Our brains use many
      different ways to store the traces of our pasts. No single word can
      describe so much, unless it is used only in a general, informal
      sense.</p>

    <p>
      Memories are processes that make some of our agents act in much the
      same ways they did at various times in the past.</p>
