<h2>14.7 the power of negative thinking</h2>
    <!--img class="illus" src="./illus/ch14/14-13.png"/!-->
    <blockquote>
When life walls us in, our intelligence cuts an opening, for, though
there be no rememdy for an unrequited love, one can win release from
suffering, even if only by drawing from the lessons it has to
teach. The intelligence does not recognize in life any closed
situations without an outlet.

    <p>
      How do boxes keep things in? Geometry is a fine tool for
      understanding shapes, but alone, it can&#39;t explain the
      Hand-Change mystery. For that, you also have to know how moving
      works! Suppose you pushed a car through that Block-Arch. Your arm
      would be imprisoned until you pulled it out. How can you comprehend
      the cause of this? The diagram below depicts an agency that
      represents the several ways an arm can move inside a rectangle. The
      top-level agent Move has four subagents: Move-Left, Move-Right,
      Move-Up, and Move-Down. (As before, we&#39;ll ignore the possibility
      of moving in and out, in three dimensions.) If we connect each of
      these sub-agents to the corresponding side of our four-sided box
      frame, each agent will be able to test whether the arm can move in
      the corresponding direction (by seeing whether there is an obstacle
      there). Then, if every direction is blocked, the arm can&#39;t move
      at all &mdash; and that&#39;s what we mean by
      being <em>trapped.</em></p>

    <p>
      The <em>---o</em> symbol indicates that each box-frame agent is
      connected to inhibit the corresponding subagent of Move. An obstacle
      to the left puts Move-Left into a can&#39;t-move state. If all four
      obstacles are present, then all four box-frame agents will be
      activated; this will inhibit all of Move&#39;s agents &mdash; which
      will leave Move itself in a can&#39;t-move state &mdash; and
      we&#39;ll know that the trap is complete.</p>

    <p>
      However, if we saw a Topless-Arch, then the Move-Up agent would not
      be inhibited, and Move would not be paralyzed! This suggests an
      interesting way to find an escape from a Topless-Arch. First you
      imagine being trapped inside a box-frame &mdash; from which you know
      there&#39;s no escape. Then, since the top block is actually
      missing, when your vision system looks for actual obstacles, there
      will be no signal to inhibit the Move-Up agent. Accordingly, Move
      can activate that agent, and your arm will move upward automatically
      to escape!</p>

    <p>
      This method has a paradoxical quality. It begins by assuming that
      escaping is impossible. Then this pessimistic mental act &mdash;
      imagining that one&#39;s arm is trapped &mdash; leads directly to
      finding a way out. We usually expect to solve our problems in more
      positive, goal-directed ways, by comparing what we have with what we
      wish &mdash; and then removing the differences. But here we&#39;ve
      done the opposite. We compared our plight, not with what we want,
      but with a situation even worse &mdash; the least desirable
      antigoal. Yet even that can actually help, by showing how the
      present situation fails to match that hopeless state. Which strategy
      is best to use? Both depend on recognizing differences and on
      knowing which actions affect those differences. The optimistic
      strategy makes sense when one sees several ways to go &mdash; and
      merely has to choose the best. The pessimistic strategy should be
      reserved for when one sees no way at all, when things seem really
      desperate.</p>
