<h2>22.3 de-specializing</h2>

    <p>
      Soon after learning how to put an apple into a pail, a child will
      discover that it now can put the apple into a box or put an onion
      into the pail. What magic tricks allow us to <em>de-specialize</em>
      whatever skills we learn? We&#39;ve already seen one way to do this
      simply by replacing certain polynemes with less specific isonomes.
      For example, our first apple-into-pail procedure was so specialized
      that it could be used only to put apples into pails &mdash; because
      it is based on using specific polynemes for those objects. However,
      the second script just as easily puts onions into pails or umbrellas
      into suitcases, because it engages no polynemes at all, but only the
      Origin and Destination pronomes. This script is more versatile
      because those pronomes can be assigned to anything! Learning to
      think in terms of isonomes must be a crucial step in many types of
      mental growth.</p>

    <p>
      None of our many chaining tricks would have much use if each were
      permanently tied to one specific polyneme like <em>owl</em>
      or <em>car</em> or
      <em>cup</em> or <em>gear.</em> However, once we learn to build our
      process scripts with isonomes, each can be applied to many kinds of
      reasoning &mdash; to logic, cause, dependency, and all the rest. But
      changing polynemes to isonomes will not always work. What could keep
      a child from trying to apply the script that works on <em>put the
	apple in the block</em> to <em>put the ocean in the cup</em>? To
      prevent such absurdities, our script must also place appropriate
      constraints on the Origin and Destination &mdash; for example, to
      ensure that the Destination must represent a container large enough
      to hold the Origin thing, and that the container be open toward the
      top. If all this seems too obvious to say, just watch a baby&#39;s
      first attempts to put an object in a pail or pick up food with a
      spoon or a fork. It takes many weeks or months of work to bring such
      skills to the point of usefulness. If we generalize too recklessly
      by changing all our polynemes to isonomes, few of our
      generalizations will actually work.</p>

    <p>
      What we call <em>generalizing</em> is not any single process or
      concept, but a functional term for the huge societies of different
      methods we use to extend the powers of our skills. No single policy
      will work for all domains of thought, and each refinement of
      technique will affect the quality of the generalizations we
      make. Converting polynemes to isonomes may be a potentially powerful
      skill, but it must be adapted to different realms. Once we
      accumulate enough examples of how a new script fails and succeeds in
      several situations, we can try to build a uniframe to embody good
      constraints. But no matter which policy we adopt, we must always
      expect some exceptions. You cannot carry birds in pails, no matter
      how well they fit inside.  Premature generalizations could lead to
      such large accumulations of constraints, censors, and exceptions
      that it would be better to retain the original polynemes.</p>
