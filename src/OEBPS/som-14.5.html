<h2>14.5 the investment principle</h2>

    <blockquote>
      To him that has, more shall be given; but from him that has not,
      the little that he has shall be taken away.
      <cite>&mdash;St. Matthew</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Some ideas acquire undue influence. The prominence of the
      body-support idea is well-deserved; no other scheme compares to its
      ability to help us link things into causelike chains. But there are
      other, not so honorable ways for ideas to gather influence.</p>

    <p>
      The Investment Principle: Our oldest ideas have unfair advantages
      over those that come later. The earlier we learn a skill, the more
      methods we can acquire for using it. Each new idea must then compete
      against the larger mass of skills the old ideas have accumulated.</p>

    <p>
      This is why it&#39;s so much easier to do new things in older
      ways. Each new idea, however good in principle, seems awkward until
      we master it. So old ideas keep gaining strength, while new ones can
      rarely catch up. Furthermore, our oldest and best-developed skills
      will be the first to spread to other realms of thought where again
      they&#39;ll start out far enough ahead to keep any new ideas from
      taking root.</p>

    <p>
      In the short run, you will usually do better by using an old idea
      than by starting out anew. If you can already play the piano well,
      it is easy to start playing the organ in the same way. The many
      superficial similarities will make it hard for you to tell which
      aspects of your old skills are unsuitable, and the easiest course is
      to keep applying your old technique, trying to patch each flaw until
      none show. In the long run, you&#39;d probably do better by starting
      fresh with a new technique &mdash; and then borrowing what you can
      from your older skills.  The trouble is that we&#39;re almost always
      immersed in the <em>short run.</em>  So the principles both of
      investment and of exception make us reluctant to tamper with our
      well-established skills and uniframes lest we endanger all that we
      have built upon those old foundations. I don&#39;t mean to say
      there&#39;s anything wrong, in principle, with using what you are
      comfortable with and already know. But it is dangerous to support
      your old ideas merely by accumulating ways to sidestep their
      deficiencies. That only increases the power of your old ideas to
      overcome new ones and could lead your style of thought to base
      itself yet all the more, as time goes by, upon less and less.</p>

    <p>
      Evolution illustrates how processes can become enslaved by the
      investment principle. Why do so many animals contain their brains
      inside their heads &mdash; as with fish, amphibians, reptiles,
      birds, and bats?  This arrangement was inherited long before our
      earliest aquatic ancestor first crawled upon the land three hundred
      million years ago.  For many of those animals &mdash; woodpeckers,
      for example &mdash; another arrangement might serve at least as
      well. But once the pattern of centralizing so many functions in the
      head was established, it carried with it great networks of
      dependencies involving many aspects of anatomy. Because of this, any
      mutation that changed any part of that arrangement would disrupt
      many other parts and lead to dreadful handicaps, at least in the
      short run of evolution. And because evolution is so inherently
      short-sighted, it would not help if, over longer spans of time, such
      changes could lead to advantages. Perhaps the best example of this
      can be seen in the fact that virtually every detail of every plant
      and animal on earth is written in terms of a genetic code that has
      scarcely changed a single bit in a billion years. It does not seem
      to be a particularly efficient or reliable code, yet so many
      structures have been based on it that all living things are stuck
      with it! To change a single detail of that code would cause so many
      proteins to get tangled up that not a single cell could live.</p>
