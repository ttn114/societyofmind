<h2>27.7 laughter</h2>

    

    <p>
      What would a Martian visitor think to see a human being laugh? It
      must look truly horrible: the sight of furious gestures, flailing
      limbs, and thorax heaving in frenzied contortions. The air is torn
      with dreadful sounds as though, all at once, that person wheezes,
      barks, and chokes to death. The face contorts in grimaces that mix
      smiles and yawns with snarls and frowns. What could cause such a
      frightful seizure? Our theory suggests a simple answer:</p>

    <p>
      The function of laughing is to disrupt another person&#39;s
      reasoning!</p>

    <p>
      To see and hear a person laugh creates such chaos in the mind that
      you can&#39;t proceed along your present train of thought. Derision
      makes you feel ridiculous; it prevents you from <em>being
	serious.</em> What happens then? Our theory has a second part:</p>

    <p>
      Laughter focuses attention on the present state of mind!</p>

    <p>
      Laughter seems to freeze one&#39;s present state of mind in its
      tracks and hold it up to ridicule. All further reasoning is
      disrupted, and only the joke-thought remains in sharp focus. What is
      the function of this petrifying effect?</p>

    <p>
      By preventing you from <em>taking seriously</em> your present
      thought, and thus proceeding to develop it, laughter gives you time
      to build a censor against that state of mind.</p>

    <p>
      In order to construct or improve a censor, you must retain your
      records of the recent states of mind that made you think the
      censored thought. This takes some time, during which your short-term
      memories are fully occupied &mdash; and that will naturally disrupt
      whichever other processes might try to change those memories.</p>

    <p>
      How could all this have evolved? Like smiling, laughter has a
      curious ambiguity, combining elements of affection and conciliation
      with elements of rejection and aggression. Perhaps all these
      ancestral means of social communication became fused to compose a
      single, absolutely irresistible way to make another person cease an
      activity regarded as objectionable or ridiculous. If so, it is no
      accident that so many jokes mix elements of pleasure, cruelty,
      sexuality, aggression, and absurdity. Humor must have grown along
      with our abilities to criticize ourselves, starting with simple
      internal suppressors that evolved into more sophisticated
      censors. Perhaps they then split off into B-brain layers that became
      increasingly able to predict and manipulate what the older A-brains
      were about to do. At this point, our ancestors must have started to
      experience what humanists call
      <em>conscience.</em> For the first time, animals could start to
      reflect upon their own mental activities and evaluate their
      purposes, plans, and goals. This endowed us with great new mental
      powers but, at the same time, exposed us to new and different kinds
      of conceptual mistakes and inefficiencies.</p>

    <p>
      Our humor-agencies become internalized in adult life as we learn to
      produce the same effects entirely inside our own minds. We no longer
      need the ridicule of those other people, once we can make ourselves
      ashamed by laughing silently at our own mistakes.</p>
