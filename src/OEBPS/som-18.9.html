<h2>18.9 robustness and recovery</h2>

    <p>
      Most machines that people build stop working when their parts break
      down. Isn&#39;t it amazing that our minds can keep on functioning
      while they&#39;re making changes in themselves? Indeed, they must,
      since minds can&#39;t simply shut down work when <em>closed for
	renovations.</em> But how do we keep functioning while vital parts
      are modified &mdash; or even lost?  It&#39;s a fact that our brains
      can keep on working well in spite of injuries in which great
      multitudes of cells are killed. How could anything be so robust?
      Here are some possibilities:</p>

    <p>
      Duplication. It is possible to design a machine so that every one of
      its functions is embodied in several duplicated agents, in different
      places.  Then, if any agent is disabled, one of its duplicates can
      be made to
      <em>take over.</em> A machine based on this duplication-scheme could
      be surprisingly robust. For example, suppose that every function
      were duplicated in ten agents. If an accident were to destroy half
      the agents of that machine, the chance that any particular function
      would be entirely lost is the same as the chance that ten tossed
      coins would all come up tails &mdash; that is, less than one chance
      in a thousand. And many regions of the human brain do indeed have
      several duplicates.</p>

    <p>
      Self-Repair. Many of the body&#39;s organs can regenerate &mdash;
      that is, they can replace whichever parts are lost to injury or
      disease. However, brain cells do not usually share this
      ability. Consequently, healing cannot be the basis of much of the
      brain&#39;s robustness. This makes one wonder why an organ as vital
      as the brain has evolved to be less able than other organs to repair
      or replace its broken parts. Presumably, this is because it simply
      wouldn&#39;t help to replace individual brain-agents &mdash; unless
      the same healing process could also restore all the learned
      connections among those agents. Since it is those networks that
      embody what we&#39;ve learned, merely to replace their separate
      parts would not restore the functions that were lost.</p>

    <p>
      Distributed Processes. It is possible to build machines in which no
      function is located in any one specific place. Instead, each
      function is
      <em>spread out</em> over a range of locations, so that each
      part&#39;s activity contributes a little to each of several
      different functions. Then the destruction of any small portion will
      not destroy any function entirely but will only cause small
      impairments to many different functions.</p>

    <p>
      Accumulation. I&#39;m sure that all of the above methods are
      employed in our brains. But we also have another source of
      robustness that offers more advantages. Consider any learning-scheme
      that begins by using the method of accumulation &mdash; in which
      each agent tends to accumulate a family of subagents that can
      accomplish that agent&#39;s goals in several ways. Later, if any of
      those subagents become impaired, their supervisor will still be able
      to accomplish its job, because other of its subagents will remain to
      do that job, albeit in different ways. So accumulation &mdash; the
      very simplest kind of learning &mdash; provides both robustness and
      versatility. Our learning- systems can build up centers of diversity
      in which each agent is equipped with various alternatives. When such
      a center is damaged, the effects may scarcely begin to show until
      the system&#39;s reserves are nearly exhausted.</p>
