<h2>27.5 jokes</h2>

    


    <p>
      Why do jokes have such peculiar psychological effects? In 1905,
      Sigmund Freud published a book explaining that we form censors in
      our minds as barriers against forbidden thoughts. Most jokes, he
      said, are stories designed to fool the censors. A joke&#39;s power
      comes from a description that fits two different frames at once. The
      first meaning must be transparent and innocent, while the second
      meaning is disguised and reprehensible. The censors recognize only
      the innocent meaning because they are too simple-minded to penetrate
      the forbidden meaning&#39;s disguise. Then, once that first
      interpretation is firmly planted in the mind, a final turn of word
      or phrase suddenly replaces it with the other one. The censored
      thought has been slipped through; a prohibited wish has been
      enjoyed.</p>

    <p>
      Freud suggested that children construct censors in response to
      prohibitions by their parents or peers. This explains why so many
      jokes involve taboos concerning cruelty, sexuality, and other
      subjects that human communities typically link to guilt, disgust, or
      shame. But it troubled Freud that this theory did not account for
      the <em>nonsense jokes</em> people seem to enjoy so much. The
      trouble was that these seemed unrelated to social prohibitions. He
      could not explain why people find humor in the idea of <em>a knife
	that has lost both its blade and its handle.</em></p>

    <p>
      Freud considered several explanations to account for pointless
      nonsense jokes but concluded that none of those theories was good
      enough. One theory was that people tell nonsense jokes for the
      pleasure of arousing the expectation of a real joke and then
      frustrating the listener. Another theory was that senselessness
      reflects <em>a wish to return to carefree childhood, when one was
	permitted to think without any compulsion to be logical, and to put
	words together without sense, for the simpler pleasures of rhythm or
	rhyme.</em> Freud put it this way:</p>

    <p>
      Little by little the child is forbidden this enjoyment, till there
      remain only significant combinations of words.
      
      But attempts still emerge to disregard restrictions which were
      learned.</p>

    <p>
      In yet a third theory, Freud conjectured that humor is a way to ward
      off suffering &mdash; as when, in desperate situations, we make
      jokes as though the world were nothing but a game. Freud suggested
      that this is when the superego tries to comfort the childlike ego by
      rejecting all reality; but he was uneasy about this idea because
      such kindliness conflicted with his image of the superego&#39;s
      usual stern, strict character.</p>

    <p>
      Despite Freud&#39;s complicated doubts, I&#39;ll argue that he was
      right all along. Once we recognize that ordinary thinking, too,
      requires censors to suppress ineffectual mental processes, then all
      the different-seeming forms of jokes will seem more similar. Absurd
      results of reasoning must be tabooed as thoroughly as social
      mistakes and inanities! And that&#39;s why stupid thoughts can seem
      as humorous as antisocial ones.</p>
