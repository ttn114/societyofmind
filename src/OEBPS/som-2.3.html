<h2>2.3 Parts and wholes</h2>

    <p>
      We&#39;re often told that certain wholes are <em>more than the sum of
        their parts.</em> We hear this expressed with reverent words
      like <em>holistic</em> and
      <em>gestalt,</em> whose academic tones suggest that they refer to clear
      and definite ideas. But I suspect the actual function of such terms is
      to anesthetize a sense of ignorance. We say <em>gestalt</em> when things
      combine to act in ways we can&#39;t explain, <em>holistic</em> when
      we&#39;re caught off guard by unexpected happenings and realize we
      understand less than we thought we did. For example, consider the two
      sets of questions below, the first <em>subjective</em> and the
      second <em>objective</em>:</p>

    <p>
      What makes a drawing more than just its separate lines?  How is a
      personality more than a set of traits?  In what way is a culture more
      than a mere collection of customs?
      
      What makes a tower more than separate blocks?  Why is a chain more than
      its various links?  How is a wall more than a set of many bricks?</p>

    <p>
      Why do the <em>objective</em> questions seem less mysterious? Because we
      have good ways to answer them &mdash; in terms of how things interact.
      To explain how walls and towers work, we just point out how every block
      is held in place by its neighbors and by gravity. To explain why
      chain-links cannot come apart, we can demonstrate how each would get in
      its neighbors&#39; way. These explanations seem almost self-evident to
      adults. However, they did not seem so simple when we were children, and
      it took each of us several years to learn how real-world objects
      interact &mdash; for example, to prevent any two objects from ever being
      in the same place. We regard such knowledge as
      <em>obvious</em> only because we cannot remember how hard it was to
      learn.</p>

    <p>
      Why does it seem so much harder to explain our reactions to drawings,
      personalities, and cultural traditions? Many people assume that
      those <em>subjective</em> kinds of questions are impossible to answer
      because they involve our minds. But that doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t
      be answered.  It only means that we must first know more about our
      minds.</p>

    <p>
      <em>Subjective</em> reactions are also based on how things interact. The
      difference is that here we are not concerned with objects in the world
      outside, but with processes inside our brains.</p>

    <p>
      In other words, those questions about arts, traits, and styles of life
      are actually quite technical. They ask us to explain what happens among
      the agents in our minds. But this is a subject about which we have never
      learned very much &mdash; and neither have our sciences. Such questions
      will be answered in time. But it will just prolong the wait if we keep
      using pseudo-explanation words like <em>holistic</em>
      and <em>gestalt.</em>  True, sometimes giving names to things can help
      by leading us to focus on some mystery. It&#39;s harmful, though, when
      naming leads the mind to think that names alone bring meaning close.</p>
