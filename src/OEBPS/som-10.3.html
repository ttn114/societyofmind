<h2>10.3 priorities</h2>

    <p>
      Let&#39;s try to explain the water jar experiment in terms of how a
      child&#39;s agencies deal with comparisons. Suppose the child begins
      with only three agents:</p>

    <p>
      Tall says, <em>The taller, the more.</em> There&#39;s more inside a
      taller thing.  Thin says, <em>The thinner, the less.</em>
      There&#39;s less inside a thinner thing.  Confined says, <em>The
	same, because nothing was added or removed.</em></p>

    <p>
      How do we know children have agents like these? We can be sure that
      younger children have agencies like Tall and Thin because they all
      can make these judgments:</p>

    <p>
      It is harder to know whether younger children have agents like
      Confined, but many of them can indeed explain that something remains
      the same when one pours a liquid back and forth. In any case, there
      is a conflict because the three agents give three different answers
      &mdash; more, less, and same! What could be done to settle this? The
      simplest theory is that the younger children have placed their
      agents in some <em>order of priority.</em></p>

    <p>
      Such a scheme can be extremely practical, since placing all the
      agents in order of priority makes it easy to know which to use. For
      example, we often compare things by their extents &mdash; by how far
      they reach in space.  But why put Tall ahead of Wide? People do
      indeed seem most sensitive to vertical extents. We do not know
      whether this is built from the start into our brains, but in any
      case, the bias is usually justified because
      <em>more height</em> so frequently goes along with other sorts of
      largenesses.</p>

    <p>
      Who&#39;s <em>bigger</em> &mdash; you or your cousin? Stand back to
      back!  Who&#39;s the strongest? Those adults looming way above!  How
      to divide a liquid into equal portions? Match the levels!</p>

    <p>
      No other agent seems so good as Tall for making everyday
      comparisons. Still, no priority-scheme will always work. In the
      situation of the water jar experiment, Confined ought to come first,
      but the younger child&#39;s priorities lead to making the wrong
      judgment.  One might wonder, incidentally, whether Tall and Short,
      or Wide and Thin, should be considered to be different
      agents. Logically, just one of each pair would suffice. But I doubt
      that in the brain it would suffice to represent Short by the mere
      inactivity of Tall. To adults these are <em>opposites,</em> but
      children do not work so logically. One child I knew insisted that
      knife was the opposite of fork, but that fork was the opposite of
      spoon. Water was the opposite of milk. As for the opposite of
      opposite, that child considered this to be too foolish to discuss.</p>
