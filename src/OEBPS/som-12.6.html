<h2>12.6 accumulation</h2>

    <p>
      Uniframing doesn&#39;t always work. We often try to make an everyday
      idea precise &mdash; but just can&#39;t find much unity. Then, we
      can only accumulate collections of examples.</p>

      It certainly is hard to find any properties that all these
      share. Coins are hard and round and flat. Bills are thin and
      flexible. Bullion has unusual weight, and credits aren&#39;t even
      physical. We recognize them all as media of trade &mdash; but that
      won&#39;t help us recognize the things themselves. The situation is
      the same for furniture. It&#39;s not so hard to say what furniture
      is for &mdash; <em>things that equip a room for living in.</em> But
      when it comes to the objects themselves, it&#39;s even hard to find
      a uniframe for <em>chair.</em> Again, its function-role seems clear
      &mdash; <em>a thing one can sit upon.</em> The problem is that one
      can sit on almost anything &mdash; a bench, a floor, a tabletop, a
      horse, a stack of bricks, a rock. Even defining Arch has problems,
      since many things we recognize as arches just don&#39;t match our
      Block-Arch uniframe:</p>

    <p>
      All these shapes could be described as <em>shape with hole</em>
      or <em>blocks that bridge across a gap.</em> But those
      descriptions would also admit many things we don&#39;t want to
      regard as arches. The simplest way to learn, when one can&#39;t
      find a uniframe, is to accumulate descriptions of experiences.</p>

    <p>
      At first it may seem simpler to accumulate examples than to find
      more uniform ways to represent them. But later there&#39;s a price
      to pay for this: when we try to reason about things, accumulations
      can be nuisances &mdash; because then we&#39;ll be forced to find a
      different argument or explanation to justify each separate
      example. Most likely, different parts of our brains have evolved to
      use both kinds of strategies.  Accumulations need not take longer to
      manipulate if all the examples can be handled at the same time, by
      separate agents that don&#39;t interfere with one another But once
      those processes begin to need each other&#39;s help, the whole
      society&#39;s efficiency will decline rapidly.  Perhaps that
      slowing-down itself might be the stimulus that makes us start to try
      to unify &mdash; at least for processes we use frequently.</p>

    <p>
      A simpler theory of when we start new uniframes would be that in the
      brain, there is an architectural constraint on how many K-lines are
      directly accessible to various types of agents. For example, the
      agents in a certain agency might be able to accumulate no more than
      about seven branches for each classification in a certain
      hierarchy. When more than that accumulate, the agency would be
      forced either to merge some examples into uniframes or to turn for
      help from somewhere else.</p>
