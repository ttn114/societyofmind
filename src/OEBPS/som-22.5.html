<h2>22.5 inference</h2>

    <p>
      Linking structures together into chains is one of our most useful
      kinds of reasoning. Suppose you learned that <em>John gave the kite
	to Mary</em> and then <em>Mary gave the kite to Jack.</em> You could
      then conclude that the kite went from John to Jack. How do we draw
      such conclusions?  Some people think we use <em>logic</em> for
      this. A simpler theory is that we do it by fitting together
      Trans-frames into chains. Suppose you see two frames like these:</p>

    <p>
      All A&#39;s are B&#39; s and All B &#39;s are C&#39;s.</p>

    <p>
      Then just combine the first Origin with the second Destination to
      make this new <em>deduction-frame</em>:</p>

    <p>
      All A&#39;s are C&#39;s.</p>

    <p>
      To do this sort of <em>reasoning,</em> we have to use our isonomes
      to rearrange our short-term memories. But this requires more than
      simple chaining. For example, all older children can infer that
      Tweety can fly from <em>Tweety is a bird</em> and <em>All birds can
	fly.</em> To do this, though, one has to deal with a disparity: the
      first B is <em>a bird</em> while the second B is <em>all birds.</em>
      To be able to make such chains would be virtually useless if we
      could do it only when both pronome assignments were absolutely
      identical. Over the years, children improve their abilities to
      decide when two different structures are similar enough to justify
      making chain-links. This often requires us to recall and apply other
      types of knowledge at appropriate level-bands of detail.</p>

    <p>
      Children take many years to learn effective ways to use their
      pronomes and isonomes. The youngest ones can neither rearrange their
      representations of physical scenes nor make the kinds of inference
      we&#39;re discussing here. To think like adults, we must develop and
      learn to use memory-controlling processes that manipulate several
      sets of pronome values at the same time. Just such a process was
      concealed in our simple script for <em>Put the apple in the
	pail</em> &mdash; which first appears to be merely a matter of
      assigning <em>apple</em> to the Origin and <em>pail</em> to the
      Destination. But you can&#39;t Put something until you Get it, so
      this must actually involve two Trans-frame operations.  The first is
      for moving your hand to the apple, and the second is for moving the
      apple to the pail. During the transition, your pronomes have to
      change their roles since the apple&#39;s location is the Destination
      of the first Trans, but then becomes the Origin of the second
      Trans. No matter that this seems too obvious to state; some mental
      process has to switch that pronome&#39;s role.</p>

    <p>
      By learning to manipulate our isonomes, we become able to combine
      mental representations into structures that resemble bridges,
      chains, and towers. Our language-agencies learn to express these in
      the form of compound sentences, by using conjunctive grammar words
      like
      <em>and,</em> <em>because,</em> or <em>or.</em> But language is not
      the only realm in which we learn to <em>conceptualize</em> &mdash;
      that is, to treat our mental processes almost as though they were
      object-things. After you solve a hard problem, you may find yourself
      representing the steps you took as if they were the parts of a
      physical structure. Doing this can enable you to reassemble them
      into other forms that achieve the same results with much more speed
      and much less thought.</p>
