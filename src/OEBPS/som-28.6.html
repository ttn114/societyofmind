<h2>28.6 minds and machines</h2>

    <p>
      Why does a mind seem so unlike any other kind of thing? First, as we
      just said, minds aren&#39;t things &mdash; at least they share none
      of the usual properties of things, like colors, sizes, shapes, or
      weights. Minds lie beyond the reach of the senses of sound, touch,
      sight, smell, and taste.  Yet though minds aren&#39;t things at all,
      they certainly have vital links to the things we call brains. What
      is the nature of those bonds? Are minds peculiar entities, possessed
      alone by brains like ours? Or could those qualities of minds be
      shared, to various degrees, by everything?  Now, when we
      said, <em>Minds are simply what brains do,</em> that should have
      made us ask as well, <em>Does every other kind of process also have
	a corresponding kind of mind?</em> This could lead to an
      argument. One side might insist that this is merely a matter of
      degree, because people have well-developed minds while bricks or
      stones have almost none.  Another side might try to draw a sharper
      boundary, arguing that only people can have minds &mdash; and,
      maybe, certain animals. Which side is right? This isn&#39;t a matter
      of wrong or right, since the issue is not about a fact, but only
      about when it&#39;s wise to use a certain word. Those who wish to
      reserve the label <em>mind</em> for only certain processes are
      obliged to specify which processes deserve that name. Those who
      claim that every kind of process has a corresponding type of mind
      are obliged to classify all minds and processes. The trouble with
      this is that we don&#39;t yet have adequate ways to classify
      processes.</p>

    <p>
      Why are processes so hard to classify? In earlier times, we could
      usually judge machines and processes by how they transformed raw
      materials into finished products. But it makes no sense to speak of
      brains as though they manufacture thoughts the way factories make
      cars. The difference is that brains use processes that change
      themselves &mdash; and this means we cannot separate such processes
      from the products they produce. In particular, brains make memories,
      which change the ways we&#39;ll subsequently think. The principal
      activities of brains are making changes in themselves. Because the
      whole idea of self-modifying processes is new to our experience, we
      cannot yet trust our commonsense judgments about such matters.</p>

    <p>
      As for brain science, no one ever before tried to study machines
      with billions of working parts. That would be difficult enough, even
      if we knew exactly how every part worked, and our present-day
      technology does not yet allow us to study the brain cells of higher
      animals while they&#39;re actually working and learning. This is
      partly because those cells are extremely small and sensitive to
      injury, and partly because they are so crowded together that we have
      not yet been able to map out their interconnections.</p>

    <p>
      These problems will all be solved once we have better instruments
      and better theories. In the meantime, the hardest problems we have
      to face do not come from philosophical questions about whether
      brains are machines or not. There is not the slightest reason to
      doubt that brains are anything other than machines with enormous
      numbers of parts that work in perfect accord with physical laws. As
      far as anyone can tell, our minds are merely complex processes. The
      serious problems come from our having had so little experience with
      machines of such complexity that we are not yet prepared to think
      effectively about them.</p>
