<h2>9.4 enjoying discomfort</h2>
    
    <p>
      Why do children enjoy the rides in amusement parks, knowing that
      they will be scared, even sick? Why do explorers endure suffering
      and pain &mdash; knowing that their very purpose will disperse once
      they arrive?  And what makes ordinary people work for years at jobs
      they hate, so that someday they will be able to &mdash; some seem to
      have forgotten what?</p>

    <p>
      There is more to motivation than immediate reward. When we succeed
      at anything, a lot goes on inside the mind. For example, we may be
      filled with feelings of accomplishment and pride, and feel impelled
      to show others what we&#39;ve done and how. However, it is the fate
      of more ambitious intellects that the sweetness of success will
      swiftly fade as other problems come to mind. That&#39;s good because
      most problems do not stand alone but are only smaller parts of
      larger problems. Usually, after we solve a problem, our agencies
      return to some other, higher-level cause for discontent, only to
      lose themselves again in other subproblems. Nothing would get done
      if we succumbed to satisfaction.</p>

    <p>
      But what if a situation gets completely out of our control &mdash;
      and offers no conceivable escape from suffering? Then all we can do
      is try to construct some inner plan for tolerating it. One trick is
      to try to change our momentary goal &mdash; as when we
      say, <em>It&#39;s getting there that&#39;s all the fun.</em> Another
      way is looking forward to some benefit to future Self:
      <em>I certainly shall learn from this.</em> When that doesn&#39;t
      work, we can still resort to even more unselfish
      schemes: <em>Perhaps others may learn from my mistake.</em></p>

    <p>
      These kinds of complications make it impossible to invent good
      definitions for ordinary words like <em>pleasure</em>
      and <em>happiness.</em> No small set of terms could suffice to
      express the many sorts of goals and wants that, in our minds,
      compete in different agencies and on different scales of time. It is
      no wonder that those popular theories about reward and punishment
      have never actually led to explaining higher forms of human learning
      &mdash; however well they&#39;ve served for training animals. For in
      the early stages of acquiring any really new skill, a person must
      adopt at least a partly antipleasure attitude:
      <em>Good, this is a chance to experience awkwardness and to discover
	new kinds of mistakes!</em> It is the same for doing mathematics,
      climbing freezing mountain peaks, or playing pipe organs with
      one&#39;s feet: some parts of the mind find it horrible, while
      other parts enjoy forcing those first parts to work for them. We
      seem to have no names for processes like these, though they must
      be among our most important ways to grow.</p>

    <p>
      None of this is to say that we can discard the concepts of pleasure
      and liking as we use them in everyday life. But we have to
      understand their roles in our psychology; they represent the end
      effects of complex ways to simplify.</p>
