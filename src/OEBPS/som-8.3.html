<h2>8.3 mental states and dispositions</h2>

    <p>
      Many modern scientists think it quaint to talk about <em>mental
	states.</em>  They feel this idea is too <em>subjective</em>
	to be scientific, and they prefer to base their theories of
	psychology on ideas about information pro- cessing. This has
	produced many good theories about problem solving, pattern
	recognition, and other important facets of psychology, but on
	the whole it hasn&#39;t led to useful ways to describe the
	workings of our dispositions, attitudes, and feelings.</p>

    <p>
      Is this because, as many think, our feelings are inherently more
      complicated than the things we more easily describe in words? Not
      necessarily: our memories of attitudes and feelings could come from
      relatively simple K-line mechanisms &mdash; yet still be
      inexpressible. This is because K-lines can easily record relatively
      widespread and diffuse activities and, later, reactivate them all at
      once. This helps explain a familiar psychological phenomenon:</p>

    <p>
      The experiences we find easiest to recollect are often just the
      kinds we find the hardest to describe.</p>

    <p>
      For example, a novice can remember how it felt to be at a concert. A
      more proficient amateur can remember more of the music itself
      &mdash; the rhythms and the harmonies and melodies. But only skilled
      musicians can recall the smaller details of timbre, texture, and
      arrangement.  Why do we find it easier to recollect our attitudes
      and feelings than to describe what actually took place? That&#39;s
      just what we should expect from memories of the K-line kind. Suppose
      that a certain sentiment or disposition involved the activities of
      many different agents. It would be easy to construct a huge K-line
      with which we could, later, make ourselves approximately
      reexperience that complicated state &mdash; simply by rearousing the
      same activities. But this would not automatically enable us to
      describe those feelings, which is another matter entirely, because
      it would require us to summarize that huge, dispersed activity in
      terms of some much more compact arrangement of verbal expressions.</p>

    <p>
      We cannot always judge the complexity of our mental states by how
      easily we can express them in words. A certain state of mind might
      involve a mass of information simply too enormous and diverse to
      express in any small number of words, yet not be very complicated in
      any interesting sense. Furthermore, the things we can express in
      words are, to a large extent, constrained by the social process
      through which we learn to use those words. In order for a word to
      have a predictable effect on other persons, we must maintain strict,
      public discipline on how that word is used &mdash; whereas each
      individual&#39;s private, internal signals need not be so
      constrained. The signals that come from our nonverbal agents can
      have K-line connections that branch out very rapidly to arouse other
      agents. If each member of such a society were to arouse a mere
      hundred others, then in only three or four steps the activity of a
      single one of them could affect a million other agents.</p>

    <p>
      Once we think in terms of K-line memories, it becomes easy to
      imagine, at least in principle, how a person could recall a general
      impression of a complex previous experience &mdash; but it becomes
      hard to understand how a person can so easily comprehend a specific
      statement like <em>John has more candy than Mary.</em> If this
      theory is correct, the traditional view must be upside down, which
      regards it as easy to understand how minds can deal
      with <em>facts</em> and
      <em>propositions,</em> but hard to see how minds could have diffuse,
      hard-to-express dispositions.</p>
