<h2>25.5 expectations</h2>

    <img class="illus" src="./illus/ch25/25-14.png"/>


    <p>
      Imagine that you turned around and suddenly faced an absolutely
      unexpected scene. You&#39;d be as shocked as though the world had
      changed before your eyes because so many of your expectations were
      not met. When we look about a familiar place, we know roughly what
      to expect. But what does expect mean?</p>

    <p>
      Whenever we become familiar with some particular environment like an
      office, home, or outdoor place, we represent it with a frame-array
      whose terminals have already been filled. Then, for each direction
      of motion inside that environment, our vision-systems activate the
      corresponding frames of that array. We also activate the
      corresponding frames even when we merely consider or imagine a
      certain body motion &mdash; and this amounts to <em>knowing what to
	expect.</em>  In general, each frame of a spatial frame-array is
      controlled by some direction-neme. However, in surroundings that are
      either especially familiar or whose relationships we do not
      understand, we may learn to use more specific stimuli instead of
      using direction-nemes to switch the frames. For example, when you
      approach a familiar door, the frame for the room that you expect to
      find behind that door might be activated, not by your direction of
      motion, but by your recognition of that particular door. This could
      explain how a person can reside in the same home for decades, yet
      never learn which of its rooms share common walls.</p>

    <p>
      In any case, all this is oversimplified. Many of our frame-arrays
      must require more than nine direction views; they need machinery to
      modify the sizes and shapes of their objects; they must be adapted
      to three dimensions; and they must be able to represent what happens
      at intermediate moments during motion from one view to another.
      Furthermore, the control of frame selection cannot depend on a
      single, simple set of direction-nemes, for we must also compensate
      for the motions of our eyes, neck, body, and legs. Indeed, a major
      portion of our brain-machinery is involved with such calculations
      and corrections, and it takes a long time to learn to use all that
      machinery.  The psychologist Piaget found that it takes ten years or
      more for children to refine their abilities to imagine how the same
      scene will appear from different viewpoints.</p>

    <p>
      This was the basis of Hogarth&#39;s complaint. The artist felt that
      many painters and sculptors never learned enough about spatial
      transformations. He felt that mental imagery is an acquired skill,
      and he scolded artists who gave too little time to <em>perfecting
	the ideas they have in their minds about the objects in nature.</em>
      Accordingly, Hogarth worked out ways to train people to better
      predict how viewpoints change appearances.</p>

    <p>
      [He who undertakes the acquisition of] perfect ideas of the
      distances, bearings, and oppositions of several material points and
      lines in even the most irregular figures, will gradually arrive at
      the knack of recalling them into his mind when the objects
      themselves are not before him &mdash; and will be of infinite
      service to those who invent and draw from fancy, as well as to
      enable those to be more correct who draw from the life.</p>
