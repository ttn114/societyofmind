<h2>8.4 partial mental states</h2>

    <p>
      We make our new ideas by merging parts of older ones &mdash; and
      that means keeping more than one idea in mind at once. Let&#39;s
      oversimplify matters for the moment and imagine that the mind is
      composed of many <em>divisions,</em> each involved with a different
      activity, like vision, locomotion, language, and so forth. This
      pattern repeats on smaller scales, so that even the thought of the
      simplest ordinary object is made up of smaller thoughts in smaller
      agencies. Thinking about a small white rubber ball could activate
      some divisions like these:</p>

    <p>
      We&#39;ll need some way to talk about the states of many agencies at
      once. So, in this book, I&#39;ll use the expression <em>mental
	state</em> or <em>total mental state</em> when talking about the
      states of all of one&#39;s agents. The new phrase <em>partial mental
	state</em> is for talking about the states of smaller groups of
      agents. Now in order to be clear, we&#39;ll have to simplify our
      picture of the situation, the way scientists do. We shall assume
      that each agent in our society, at each moment, is either in a
      <em>quiet state</em> or an <em>active state.</em> Why can&#39;t an
      agent be partially aroused, instead of only <em>on</em>
      or <em>off</em>? They could indeed, but there are technical reasons
      why this would not make any fundamental difference to the issues we
      are discussing here. In any case, this assumption allows us to be
      precise:</p>

    <p>
      A <em>total state</em> of mind is a list that specifies which agents
      are active and which are quiet at a certain moment.
      
      A <em>partial state</em> of mind merely specifies that certain
      agents are active but does not say which other agents are quiet.</p>

    <p>
      Notice that according to this definition, a mind can have exactly
      one total state at any moment, but it can be in many partial states
      at the same time &mdash; because partial states are incomplete
      descriptions. The picture above shows a mind-society made up of
      several separate divisions, so we can think of each division&#39;s
      state as one partial state, and this lets us imagine that the entire
      system can <em>think several thoughts at once,</em> just as a crowd
      of separate people can. When your speech division is being occupied
      with what your friend is saying while your vision division looks for
      a door to exit through &mdash; then your mind is in two partial
      states at once.</p>

    <p>
      The situation is more interesting when two K-lines activate agents
      in the same division at the same time: imposing two different
      partial mental states on the same agency can lead to conflicts. It
      is easy to think of a small white ball because this activates
      K-lines that connect to unrelated sets of agents. But when you try
      to imagine a round square, your agents for round and square are
      forced to compete to control the same set of shape-describing
      agents. If the conflict is not settled soon, noncompromise may
      eliminate both &mdash; and leave you with the sense of an undefined
      shape.</p>
