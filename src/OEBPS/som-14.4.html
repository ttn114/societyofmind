<h2>14.4 brainstorming</h2>

    <p>
      Once you set that nine-dot problem into a larger frame, you could
      solve it in a routine way, with only a little thought. What lets you
      reformulate such complex scenes so easily &mdash; once you&#39;ve
      thought of doing it? It must be that your mind is constantly
      preparing ways to do such things by building up connections between
      different kinds of descriptions. Then, when you finally change your
      view to find another way to look at things, you can apply a lifetime
      of experience as easily as turning on a switch.</p>

    <p>
      This takes us back to the question of when to try to be a
      Reductionist or a Novelist. How do you decide when to quit after
      investing a great deal of effort in doing something a certain way?
      It would be bad to discard all that work just before you might find
      the answer &mdash; but there&#39;s no way to be sure when that will
      happen. Should people always try to break their well established,
      self-made mental bonds and try to think in less constricted ways? Of
      course not. It will usually do more harm than good.</p>

    <p>
      However, when you&#39;re really stuck, you may as well try wilder
      ways to find some new ideas. You might even consider using one of
      the systematic, therapylike disciplines that go under names like
      brainstorming, lateral thinking, meditation, and so forth. These can
      help, when people get badly stuck, by encouraging the search for new
      formulations. However, when you switch to unfamiliar views of things
      you may get new ideas, but you also put yourself in the situation of
      a novice; you become less able to judge which new ideas are likely
      to be compatible with any of your older skills.</p>

    <p>
      In any case, you must not be too quick to think, How stupid it was
      not to see that right away! Remember the principle of exceptions: it
      may be rash to change yourself too much just to accommodate a single
      strange experience. To take every exception seriously is to risk the
      loss of general rules that previous experience has shown to work
      most frequently. You must also be particularly wary of methods you
      can always use:</p>

    <p>
      Quit what you&#39;re doing.  Find an easier problem.  Take a
      rest. You&#39;ll feel better afterward.  Simply wait. Eventually the
      situation will change.  Start over again. Things may work out better
      the next time.</p>

    <p>
      Such methods are too general; they&#39;re things that one can always
      do, but they do not apply especially well to any particular
      problem. Sometimes they can help us get unstuck, but they must be
      barred from usual thought &mdash; or at least be given low
      priority. It isn&#39;t any accident that the things that we
      can <em>always</em> do are just the ones we should rarely do.</p>
