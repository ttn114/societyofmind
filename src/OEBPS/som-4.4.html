<h2>4.4 the conservative self</h2>

    <p>
      How do we control our minds? Ideally, we first choose what we want to
      do, then make ourselves do it. But that&#39;s harder than it sounds: we
      spend our lives in search of schemes for self-control. We celebrate when
      we succeed, and when we fail, we&#39;re angry with ourselves for not
      behaving as we wanted to &mdash; and then we try to scold or shame or
      bribe ourselves to change our ways. But wait! How could a self be angry
      with itself? Who would be mad at whom? Consider an example from everyday
      life.</p>

    <p>
      I was trying to concentrate on a certain problem but was getting bored
      and sleepy. Then I imagined that one of my competitors, Professor
      Challenger, was about to solve the same problem. An angry wish to
      frustrate Challenger then kept me working on the problem for a
      while. The strange thing was, this problem was not of the sort that ever
      interested Challenger.</p>

    <p>
      What makes us use such roundabout techniques to influence ourselves?
      Why be so indirect, inventing misrepresentations, fantasies, and
      outright lies? Why can&#39;t we simply tell ourselves to do the things
      we want to do?</p>

    <p>
      To understand how something works, one has to know its purposes.  Once,
      no one understood the heart. But as soon as it was seen that hearts move
      blood, a lot of other things made sense: those things that looked like
      pipes and valves were really pipes and valves indeed &mdash; and
      anxious, pounding, pulsing hearts were recognized as simple pumps.  New
      speculations could then be formed: was this to give our tissues drink or
      food? Was it to keep our bodies warm or cool? For sending messages from
      place to place? In fact, all those hypotheses were correct, and when
      that surge of functional ideas led to the guess that blood can carry air
      as well, more puzzle parts fell into place.</p>

    <p>
      To understand what we call the Self, we first must see what Selves are
      for. One function of the Self is to keep us from changing too rapidly.
      Each person must make some long-range plans in order to balance
      single-purposeness against attempts to do everything at once. But it is
      not enough simply to instruct an agency to start to carry out our
      plans. We also have to find some ways to constrain the changes we might
      later make &mdash; to prevent ourselves from turning those plan-agents
      off again! If we changed our minds too recklessly, we could never know
      what we might want next. We&#39;d never get much done because we could
      never depend on ourselves.</p>

    <p>
      Those ordinary views are wrong that hold that Selves are magic,
      self-indulgent luxuries that enable our minds to break the bonds of
      natural cause and law. Instead, those Selves are practical necessities.
      The myths that say that Selves embody special kinds of liberty are
      merely masquerades. Part of their function is to hide from us the nature
      of our self-ideals &mdash; the chains we forge to keep ourselves from
      wrecking all the plans we make.</p>
