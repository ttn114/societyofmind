<h1>30 Mental Models</h1>
<h2>30.1 knowing</h2>

    <p>
      What does <em>knowing</em> really mean? Suppose Mary (or some other
      creature or machine) can answer certain questions about the world
      &mdash; without the need to do any actual experiments. Then we&#39;d
      agree that Mary knows those things about the world. But what would
      it mean, to you or to me, to hear Jack say that <em>Mary knows
	geometry</em>? For all we know, Mary might believe that circles are
      squares and it happens that Jack agrees! Jack&#39;s statement tells
      us more about Jack than about Mary.</p>

    <p>
      When Jack says, <em>Mary knows geometry,</em> this indicates to us
      that Jack would probably be satisfied by Mary&#39;s answers to the
      questions about geometry that he would be disposed to ask.</p>

    <p>
      The meaning of <em>Mary knows geometry</em> depends on who is saying
      it.  After all, no one knows everything about geometry; that
      statement would not mean the same to us as to a mathematician, whose
      concepts of geometry are different from those of ordinary
      persons. In the same way, the meanings of many other terms depend
      upon the speaker&#39;s role. Even an apparently unambiguous
      statement like <em>This is a painting of a horse</em> shares this
      character: you can be sure of little more than that it displays a
      representation that in someone&#39;s view resembles a horse in some
      respects.</p>

    <p>
      Then why, when we talk about knowledge, don&#39;t we have to say who
      all those speakers and observers are? Because we make assumptions by
      default. When a stranger says that Mary knows geometry, we simply
      assume that the speaker would expect any typical person who knows
      Mary to agree that she knows geometry. Assumptions like that allow
      us to communicate; unless there is some reason to think otherwise,
      we assume that all the things involved are <em>typical.</em> It does
      not bother us that a professional mathematician might not agree that
      Mary knows geometry &mdash; because a mathematician doesn&#39;t fit
      our stereotype of a <em>typical person.</em></p>

    <p>
      You might maintain that none of this applies to you, since you know
      what you know about geometry. But there&#39;s still an observer on
      the scene, only now it is hiding inside your mind &mdash; namely,
      the portion of
      <em>you</em> that claims you know geometry. But the part of you that
      makes this claim has little in common with the other parts that
      actually do geometry for you; those agencies are probably incapable
      of speech and probably devoid of thoughts about your knowledge and
      beliefs.</p>

    <p>
      Naturally, we&#39;d all prefer to think of knowledge as more
      positive and less provisional or relative. But little good has ever
      come from trying to link what we believe to our ideals about
      absolute truths. We always yearn for certainty, but the only thing
      beyond dispute is that there&#39;s always room for doubt. And doubt
      is not an enemy that sets constraints on what we know; the real
      danger to mental growth is perfect faith, doubt&#39;s antidote.</p>
