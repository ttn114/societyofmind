<h2>6.7 the causal now</h2>

    <p>
      Our everyday ideas about the progression of mental time are
      wrong: they leave no room for the fact that every agent has a
      different causal history. To be sure, those different pasts are
      intermixed over longer spans of time, and every agent is
      eventually influenced by what has happened in the common, remote
      history of its society. But that&#39;s not what one means
      by <em>now.</em> The problem is with the connections between the
      moment-to-moment activities of largely separate agencies.</p>

    <p>
      When a pin drops, you might say, <em>I just heard a pin drop.</em> But
      no one says, <em>I hear a pin dropping.</em> Our speaking agencies know
      from experience that the physical episode of pin dropping will be over
      before you can even start to speak. But you would say, <em>I am in
	love,</em> rather than <em>I was just in love,</em> because your
      speaking agencies know that the agencies involved with personal
      attachments work at a slower pace, with states that may persist for
      months or years. And, in between, when someone asks, <em>What sorts of
	feelings have you now?</em>  we often find our half-formed answers wrong
      before they can be expressed, as other feelings intervene. What seems
      only a moment to one agency may seem like an era to another.</p>

    <p>
      Our memories are only indirectly linked to physical time. We
      have no absolute sense of when a memorable
      event <em>actually</em> happened. At best, we can only know some
      temporal relations between it and certain other events. You
      might be able to recall that X and Y occurred on different days
      but be unable to determine which of those days came earlier. And
      many memories seem not to be linked to intervals of time at all
      &mdash; like knowing that four comes after three, or that <em>I
      am myself.</em></p>

    <p>
      The slower an agency operates &mdash; that is, the longer the
      intervals between each change of state &mdash; the more external
      signals can arrive inside those intervals. Does this mean that
      the outside world will appear to move faster to a slow agency
      than to a faster agency?  Does life seem swift to tortoises, but
      tedious to hummingbirds?</p>
