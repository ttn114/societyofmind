<h2>20.7 connections</h2>

    <p>
      To speak and understand a language well, an ordinary person must
      learn thousands of words. To learn the proper use of a single word
      must involve great numbers of connections between the agents for
      that word and other agents. What could cause such connections to be
      made, and what might be their physical embodiments?</p>

    <p>
      Any comprehensive theory of the mind must include some ideas about
      the nature of the connections among agents. Consider that a person
      can learn to <em>associate</em> virtually any combination of ideas
      or words.  Does this require us to assume that it is possible for a
      given K-line agent to become connected, directly, to any of
      thousands or millions of other agents? That seems out of the
      question, in view of what we know about connections in the human
      brain. Many brain cells have fibers that branch out enough to
      approach many thousands of other cells &mdash; but few of them
      branch out enough to reach millions of other cells, and as far as we
      know, a mature brain cell can only make new connections to other
      cells that already lie close to the fibers that branch into or out
      from it. Furthermore, we do not seem to grow many new brain cells
      after birth; on the contrary, their number actually decreases. To be
      sure, brain cells continue to <em>mature</em> for several years, and
      probably their fibers grow extensively. But no one yet knows whether
      this comes about as a result of learning new connections or whether
      it must happen first, to make it feasible for those cells to learn
      new connections.</p>

    <p>
      Even the arrangements of long-distance connections between our brain
      cells do not permit direct connection between arbitrary pairs of
      agents, for those long connections are generally arranged in
      relatively orderly bundles, less regular but otherwise resembling
      the parallel pathways from skin to brain. Fortunately, direct
      connections are not really necessary, for the same reasons that
      every telephone in the world can easily be connected to any other
      telephone without the need for connecting a billion separate wires
      to each house. Instead, telephone systems make their connections
      indirectly, by using agencies called <em>exchanges</em> that require
      only moderate numbers of wires. I don&#39;t mean to suggest that
      brains use the sorts of switching-schemes found in telephone systems
      but only to say that it is not necessary for every K-line agent to
      directly contact every agent to which it might eventually become
      linked.</p>

    <p>
      There are several factors that reduce the magnitude of the
      interconnection problem. First, in order to reproduce the major
      features of a remembered partial state of mind, it should suffice to
      activate only a representative sample of its agents. Second,
      according to our theory of knowledge-trees, most K-lines&#39;
      connections are indirect to begin with, since they connect only to
      other, nearby K-line trees. A polyneme, too, need be connected only
      to a single memorizer agent near each agency. And no K-line needs
      potential connections to all the agents in any agency, since it is
      enough to make connections only in a certain level-band.</p>
